"If you like this episode, don't forget to like share, subscribe, and I will see you next time and another episode."
How do you say though? It's is there a welcome back to clarity?
"We have a special guest on the show. Welcome young, guys. Look at what we all my God. Let me know that y'all look great in it."
I put question want to make that I don't know. Maybe might just change it to Rodger.
"Young and young-at-heart Rodger. The male guest, on our show a sentence that uses putting out. Today. We have a male guests because we are going to discuss emotions."
"Kids taking me out of therapy and despise, everything, nice spice boys, Five Below. What are you been up to some spice boy, and all that, plug in that I've just been occupied with a few things, piece of being. One of my biggest babies right now. It's finally out. So I'm very happy that you guys are rocking. It did mention that, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy Mommy. Yo, Jimmy Fallon, one of the most unexpected moments ever know. Nobody knew was going to happen. Nobody for my team knew it was a very emotional day. Actually. I cried my mom. My mom cry. My Dad, cried everybody."
"Very emotional day. Because, you know, it has always been about how far can you push this, right? Like Jimmy knows like, you know, way back in the days when you study together the dream to a different. I mean, like being active. But the dreams were essentially the same and try to be somebody trying to do something great to know for my family for myself. So the Jimmy Fallon thing was like a, what was a testament that Anything Can Happen? Anytime that you dreams are real. Like every month. I text Rodger. I say I'm so proud of you but he still the same on the inside and that's what counts as soon as that on that day as well. Well, it was yours, She's mine and we saw everybody come together. You'll accept Brian's friend."
"But I'm sure it just made instant noodles. Very happy. I'm going to take 20 minutes off. I'm going to eat my noodles. Just sat down, had to buy the message came in. It's never going to eat. It was worth it. And I saw on YouTube, one of the top searches was young Rodger to me that way, but it was younging. I don't get it right that we have to continue with you talk about. So what better time there is done today to talk about it, show emotions, but no women, we can cry with weave. Is that really true though. It is they make it sound like it's bad like, oh, you goes cry all the time while he was in the most people. Abused that soft like a negative connotation."
"I come from a traditional South Indian family. My dad is, is an elderly man, is his past. 70 is not right for that generation of traditional thinking. People don't really give much respect a room for emotion. Especially the men. I don't think he has a very good relationship with his emotions. I know him being an elderly man from South India and I'm pretty sure the environment than was not very welcoming for for emotions. When it comes to guys and it's just a stigma that we still have, we still continue to have. And I think now that we're talking about this now is the time for us to bring these statements and can reinvent whatever social construct, we have when it comes to things like motions."
"Cardi B. You don't just being a self-respecting yourself, especially the musician as well. Do you find that you try to educate with that about you do emotions have nothing right now, but in a generation away when trying to unload the stuff that we had learned from them and we're trying to learn again and we try and bring them along with us as well as I've been to you. No problem because if you understand that everybody is struggling to talk about this, right? So it's not a matter of sitting down and going like that. Listen is what I want. It's not like that. It's like trying to ease them into the idea of things have changed, right? Where the generations go by. Now people are more open to talk about things that they consider sensitive. They consider taboo, even in try to do it in the list of ways, you know, where is wearing hearing the weather? Is it getting my nails painted is like pointing back to truth?"
"Pointing back to what I want? What I feel like. So they start to see that this generation is way more in tune with the Inner Space, inner self and what they have been kind of I wouldn't say they're out of touch with it, but they don't give as much."
"My phone in my love. I love them. And I'm doing so much for all the young boys out there. That's CU, you know, I can get my nails done too. Why not? That's something that I find. Very inspiring and actually painting nails with something that I've always dreamed about like, you know, I can't wait to go for a minute. It was never that it was never like something I was waiting to do but I understood the weight. It has on a macro level, but I love my nephews and nieces that look up to me. Now. I'm their favorite uncle. They look at me for everything. All right."
"Play Jay gwuapo very open-minded about it in the beginning. But then he understood that he understood why? I was doing certain things. I have not liked what I was mentioning is not like, I understand the gravity of what certain actions have, you know, I understand the place that I'm in in my community, how setting things of you, I understand how guys painting straight men painting nails and then hold the view that, right. So being an Isis, being a rapper from day, one that has been a matter of breaking, the steering type and breaking whatever mode that people plays as in it with as an artist. You have that option. You have that choice and hope you have better freedom to express because it's about expression with, you know, it doesn't just stick with stay with words, with what you wear, what you do my parents understood that"
"My parents understood that it was all a part of the job. That mean, at least they see it like that which helps them understand it better. But you, you're in a creative space, you and you're a musician and all that you're used to expressing your emotions through your music. What about that? Say, your peers who may be there in a mall? Imagine someone in business lawyer, reminder, Nails in this day and age, they want to express themselves in what works for themselves. What works for me for meet how I see expression is, is boundless in anything, you do anything, you like anything, you feel like you can look at some of the most iconic fashion guys. Like Dennis Rodman from the 90s where the Travis Carter Harry Styles, you know, who this is, do what they like, you know, and it doesn't fall within any."
"Piccola construct of anybody, any? Any any can do? We have a label there type? It doesn't fall within that, you know, which is great. You know, somebody that is not an active. They may be a bit more on painting. The other everybody has a different way. I don't like I have friends that struggle with expressing that deep insecurities or whatever it is that going to write. But with empathy if we all are consciously practicing empathy which is basically the ability to listen without casting judgment and just be there because people don't really need you to tell them things like 90% of the time but where I think we can all do better collect."
"DS1 species is what one humidity, right? We can all talk about this so that we can all be more conscious about being empathetic, and just being there for one, another and is listening at all, because that does a great deal. Cuz when you listen to your friend what day actually doing that talking, the unpacking, the old thoughts and through that Define clarity, so it's not meant to be strong thoughts. The thing is that, we've been conditioned to think that men need to be strong, right? And not just in physical strength as an emotional being you grow. Let me know. I grew up, not seeing my dad cry even once"
"He's freaking emotional that used to it. And he when he was growing up, his parents with Fidelity at his feelings. And how are you feeling what you want to do? Anything your group vagina? You grow balls for what a vagina is strong. I hope no one thinks that way because if you feel like you have to be strong for somebody's then who's going to be strong for you? Like you're going to do it for yourself if you're going to cry because they it's you. So whatever works for you and whatever, you know pushes you follow it or just help seeing that Jenny. I grew up in the very traditional family. I've always heard from my my father is my father and my uncles and my nephew Falls. I do always tell them you are a boy."
"Like with this kind of mindset and Eve. My brother Christ, I would think it's a form of weakness and I am ashamed that I have once thought this way to the unloading. Now that we're in this phase of life. We know what's right and what's wrong, it's time to. I forget what that we have learned growing up, me know, and like this. But that's why I mentioned about empathy just now because we cannot blame her parents. Instead of all y'all are so close. My dear Barbara, because the truth is, they were victims of the environment and the environment Den, required certain modes of living. So the men had to, you know,"
"Walla Walla. They weren't allowed to be vulnerable. They weren't capable of being vulnerable because times Denver rough know we do. If I, I hear my dad talked about the sixties and I'm like, how the hell did you survive the 60s man? That sounds like a different planet altogether? Think in this day and age, we men are still more emotional than men together. Are women more emotional than men 321. Yes."
"If I say, yes."
"Obvious from the SS. Okay. I am very emotional myself. This guy used to date. He is way less emotional than me is more rational. So, of course, I feel like this is right and I actually like it that his less emotional than me because I asked him about it. Be me because I'm in the things, right. I have a lot of emotions. I need to express know that I don't completely agree to yes, but I feel like is like neutral a lot of guys that are more emotional than some of the girls that I know. I do a lot of a lot of girls that are smaller than some of the guys that I don't show up."
"The matter of degree of like, how emotional you are and is not even on a judgmental Point, like, oh my God, like you are. So we all know that fax, some of us are more emotional than this but it's a matter of light. Do we understand and accept that are not know? It's in which aspect as well? Because some people are just more. So with male friends majority of my friends are guys and this always regarded me as one of them since I've been there."
"And I don't think it's because I'm not in touch with my emotions because I am loves me. But I feel like now that I look back on it. I think it came from my childhood. So they know this. But I'll give you a summary. So, basically, I'm having gone through whatever she did and I think she was, it was a tough, but at that, it's right for like, six. I felt the need to not show my emotions tend to be that pillow for her because I want to cry that's going to hurt her. So I didn't do that if I'm going to ask her whether it is it's going to be tough on her. So I held that back. So you had to be a Pillar of Strength."
"This is super insightful into how people how environment and how experiences change people that are like, I can, I can understand why your friends would call you like to have for blacktop, you know, people don't really have a choice now. It's like you either you adapt or die type of thing, at all. When, when life is giving you such a difficult experience to accept, write a difficult situation. Do you must accept or you can choose to not like, you know, it stinks when your in survival mode and I seen you just sold a fine, the first thing that works best for you so that you carry on. And for me, it was shutting it necessary motion and just choosing to be happy. But in that I think in that choice that I made a lot of the way I feel like maybe I was in denial."
"I never allowed myself to feel those things. And at some point, this would have come back in different ways and some days you want to let go, being this way. Yeah, but a cheese spread dip if you like women more emotional than like, well guys are seeing now that it's okay. I think I'm just dealing with Johnny and because it's always been difficult with Annette said, so right now, you know, we we express a little more freely. I believe, emotions is passion fruit. Passion about something. I mean, look at the men in your life. They have their own passions, you know, sometimes to get a bit like excited about them, that is expressing emotions. It's just that I've been showing the vulnerable side when I was younger. I didn't really see it, my family, but as We Grew Older, you know, all the shit came out. I've seen everyone cried at this point all along."
"That I think they suppress them for so many years to protect us. When we were young, women are more emotional than men. I just think that Express him a different ways. I agree to Aegis it and like now I'm 25, you know, growing up in a family, especially when my parents are way older than me. The generation gap is so wide and they come from a different era. Like I mentioned, I didn't, I don't think I had the proper tools to feel and unpack certain emotions are especially the vulnerable ones. It'll, and as the boy, the whole Stickman boys, right? Lol boys, can cry. I know that but I grew up around three sisters, my mom, my grandma, you know, so the feminine energy was strong growing up. So I was I never thought of it as like voice can cry, but in my teenage years that was conditioned"
"D&h, and this is one question that don't think any of us can answer. I feel like a huge part of what country boots to this is NS Nationals live in the ocean, or I was very lucky guy. I knew from a very young age that when I go to Ennis, I don't want to be in the, in a combat Department. I knew I knew from a very young age that I would only want to be named DC with this music and Drama Camp. Now they have to change to so drama. And yeah, so I I made my move into trying to figure out how to get an empty seat and I'm going to damn busy. So my entire two years. I spent my my my energy is being an MC. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to do something that is still a lining with my passion. I mean, I'm seeing is not what I initially dreamed of being."
"Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs industry, I knew that it is still in the media scene and is still in the world that I want to be in as an adult. So it was great. It was foundational stuff like Commando as a diver, you know those guys diesel like what they are. Not the kind of people where you want to talk about. Emotions Weaver."
"I have a friend who is also in in the most elite unit in Singapore over know, what do you need to call? Have a friend from that you and he was telling me about his training regimen. Right likes training routine. Everyday is a wake up 5 a.m. Run 10 km and then do this until I backed Back. Carry like we need 30 killer whale and then run again at night. Light is just ridiculous. Like you it doesn't make sense and I don't wonder if these guys"
"Even think about emotions and it feels like, I'm too busy trying to train to be a fighter, a killer red stone. Don't put me back with your emotional emotional that the Bible to give the order to do. They find a girlfriend, but she is so much right now. I wonder if they have any form of ID because if you are environmental expecting you to be an elite soldier."
"But yes, I can do. It said it's going to resurface in ways that are very damaging to you. The only way for you to not have it resurfaced again is if you unpack it too pretty to be a need to provide the safe space and then knowing how to bring it out. To people, ready in the direction. We will talk. We will talk to their wives girlfriend, whatever it is, right, but it's like you're not capable of doing those things. And if you're not given the same space, to express those things, and unpack those things then."
"It's just like it's going to haunt you and every point of your life and and because we are on our way to certify change things. Just even if you reach out to one single person out there who looks at you and just go while, I don't have to be all that different for you. And you only dating experiences. Have you ever had go to expect that sort of masculinity from you gender stereotypes that come with dating, right? I've definitely did the step think that the guy should always pay, the guy should open the door. The guy should do this and that there's nothing wrong with that. In the dating phase is, is fine. That's why I mentioned that. I don't mind playing this thing within the the gender roles that hath."
"Being around for years, decades centuries. I don't know how long they've been wrong. Once you go deep into it, right? Then you can talk about this."
"But why must be the whole time? I like for fun in a bank is it? And I come on up. Let me know if Costco is, is is logical, right? It's like, if I pay 5 times, 5 times in a row, 6 time is not wrong for you. To be aware of the fact that I've been paying this whole time. He's not wrong for you, to be aware of it and try to do something nice back. It's not like I'm expecting my guy friends about this tomato flying reciprocation. I was like, you know, which I think is needed and is healthy for a long-term relationship about the money, you know, the money is not an issue at all."
And I think I it's okay cuz I sit and say that yo.
"Make a note 4 years. You keeping for years, only the labor face because you're going to pose a lot of questions relationship with each other into such difficult conditions. Cool. I would do those things where I want to go through the whole nine yards. Like, I think that's what makes the most whatever little things like that, and when it comes to dating, but the change I cannot be like forever."
"And emotional creature. And how do you deal with emotions? Are the one that is the one of values episode of the loud. Say this is the most important value and also patience because people that I want to mention that people have different means of unpacking and processing. What they're going through. It can never admit his mistake with my friends before, you know, my friends are going through something in this difficult time and they're constantly in that negative space. I have made the mistake of being upset that my friend is not moving out of it. Like come on man. It's been months. What are you doing right now? I didn't say it. But I felt it inside after some of those kinds of experience. I realize that you should never put your own views or emotions on the others because everybody is going through their own Jenny, their own, Jenny of battles of trauma of heel."
"Everybody has a different timing. Everybody has a different path of moving to Witts a better place, right? Like getting killed. So if he's going through something, I just listen a minute to sit down and listen to just be patient. I like patient until she get to the bottom of it. So let's get to the bottom of you say everything you want. One person to fucking listen. I don't talk after you're done everything. They want to see split up everything, then maybe I could share with you, what I feel about it. But what I feel about it should never be prioritized over what you feel. And I mean, as a friend, as a partner, as a family member, has an uncle, with whatever it is that you are. I think that is something that we all need to be aware for all you guys are in relationships out there. And so, she just wants you to listen."
"What is question? Do you want me to just, listen and tell you, what the hell you want to do? Nothing that causes friction in yet because of any negative or malicious intentions. They want to help write the help or not, like that, says something to you. Is your job to be aware and are they questioned before hand? Because if you assume that they need help, and they're coming to you for help and you handle the situation wrong be going through there. Sometimes. The best thing is to just listen to validate their feelings, but I think it's interesting that you brought up there. Can I ask you like possibly have you been to therapy before and do you think more"
"And should go for therapy 100%. I think one of the biggest problems we have in the world of mental health is the stigma that is attached to therapy and the stigma attached to conversations about mental health. I think people feel that they're peaceful pussies like to put in one liner. I think a lot of guys, a lot of guys think that thing that I have friends that think that until they go through some shit and they are finding it super difficult to cope with certain things and they feel like, oh my God, I need help is one of those things that you cannot really know the weight of it of how much therapy helps. If you don't go through it and going through a lot. You never be able to empathize, you know that certain things in life. You will not really know until you know, there is one of those things but one way I feel."
"We can mitigate this issue is by talking about it. And the more people we have opening about the difficult experiences, the better, it'll be for the collective understanding of how important therapy is how important talking about. Mental health is, and how important it is, especially moving forward in the world that in a world where depression is going up. So it's going up, y'all going to push it. Good points about how we as a society which expression is so important. No, listening to people don't go in for therapy. Didn't want to listen to you. What you think are the right values. He said that, it's okay, that emotions. It's okay to express them. You know how whenever you go out, right and then some parents like when their kids are making noise, it was."
"Unless you're embarrassing me off their emotional capacity. You don't have that kind of a parenting and that, like a major, you can blame it because their parents probably read them. So we we just continue habits that have been passed down, Letterman. What you would do. As a parent, would be exactly what your parents did. But those parents that make a choice in what my parents did this to me. I am not going to do this to my child. So I will change right but until that person because out and it understands the fact that they have to switch the patent then we have new. We have knew better Revenue way of parenting about not your decision, parents are just following the traditions."
"Even if you realize that your child is making a mistake. It might be a mistake that they have to make for themselves or touch a candle burn himself. Or herself is a recently discovered parenting Tik-Tok, but I discovered this dream of tiktoks of parents showing. What kind of language they use to the, the, the three year olds that are throwing a tantrum. How patient there. How did talk, what kind of wish they use in the show? It on the step by step is 1 M that I wore those super interesting fact about that first. You just listen to calm them down and I think the second one was to validate their feelings. I understand that you are upset."
"Moving toward the place where they can find a solution in this world is going to be a much better place. Not ready to be a parent to never be pretty open a bank account for a child that you can, like, set up the things that are necessary to welcome a child. But here in fear House Development, play a large role in the gender differences. So gender differences will not fall in infancy country to popular belief, but they were ambushed by the toddler preschool. And in childhood"
"Born with Zak an emotional incapacity, where to learn it the children's brains, develop the most between the ages of three to six times. This message. I don't know if you've seen but very recently. There was a post that went viral about a 14-0 go with to go in life in China yet and she eventually to her mother and just basically saying that this is for all the times that you used. All those, what to me? You say, I'm useless. Okay, you said you don't, I'm worth nothing. I hope you're happy now. I think this is something we can all this time, because we have all had what's like that halted Us in this world. The moment while they're angry."
"I don't think they understand that you say in that moment, York it carries, it was then yeah, and you know, for the rest of us or for those of us who were capable. We just push, those went away. But there are those who will believe that the one moment where you let your tongue? Go hammer of sleep is a lifetime of regret could be a lifetime. You're so heartbreaking. I think it's parents, you know, we don't expect them to be perfect. So let's let's start with our generation that see how we can better serve our children and the Next Generation. I think it was important to be more accepting. Like, what I mentioned just now is simple to just set, everything aside all your friend who singing right now."
"What's interesting is that people don't even know how to ask you to lend a listening ear. We want is to spend time and talk about what they going through, but people are not able to voice and say, Amen. Listen, can we go for drinks tonight? I have something to talk about what is wrong with showing your vulnerability to? We feel like that's not, okay, or is not socially acceptable as acceptable yet. So we are like shying about this because for art high schools and get a true friends. I don't think we've ever faced this issue. Like when I buy something with no matches, I just pop a text into a group chat with sexy. Ladies, by the way."
"I just say, you know, what can we hang out? Like I have something to tell you guys and I need to just get this off my chest, always be so ready to let me listen. You like women arrested in this expect we are okay to do. So, I'll go friends that we need help me. Support your emotional invalidation. Really happens when I talk to my dad and I tell him know, I'm feeling this way. This way, this way. You just tell me no lies. It's all in your head. Will Dad is not eating but they're from a different generation. So I try to coax emotions out of him. Like you do. I put Pursley got my dad and be like, so. Happy that with my earrings. Look my nails like it, right? Yeah. I love it. I hope it's nice to see these things because I won my parents and my family members to know that. I'll do what I"
"Turn off constantly, prioritize my happiness over your acceptance, but it is not more important than my happiness by Bubba lizing. It's saying that you normalize as well as for your young cousin and get kicked out of the house. They came in with colored hair like this year's, you know, Chris is in traditional Super Bowl traditional parenting families right in my in my cousin's. Wedding is in the sky with earrings. Oh my God has come to Los Angeles. That you just makes me more motivated and be like to just be myself. Is that why what kind of treatment pain is news?"
"But if you do have a problem with that, it's not my job to like change your views on how you see how you see. He's always more important than what you see. So I don't love that idea. I love that because when my kids grow up, if my child is bisexual or gay or whatever. Of course, I like I would I would want to know how I can support. I want to know how I can support you the best way possible. I mean, this is an example of anything else, right? I don't want my child to ever feel like whatever he or she is going through a race is not and cannot be accepted, like coming back to my cousins. They feel like they cannot follow their dreams. They cannot do this and that because it's not accepted, right, but if it's regarding your happiness, and you said it,"
"Your life then levels happiness is very, very important to get to that level it count. If you have to write, don't be afraid to speak to people and I think men sometimes asking for help because they feel, it is a sign of weakness. We're here telling you that it's not snowing or like, just call you. Wanting of therapy. You need new friends."
"Any friend of them things that stuck with me and my last conversation Rodger was just him telling me that, it's the people, you surround yourself with that is the most important.

I didn't, I didn't do it again for a couple of years, because I was very scared, and very shocked. And I remember when it first happened, the first thing that came to my mind was I need to get tested now, but I never did because I didn't know how, I do know what to do, and I think because of that, it kind of walked my feelings to WhatsApp for a long time.

"I do want to touch on one aspect of you define. Really interesting thing. You have a list of accomplishments that you have a real. How do you feel about it? Because I still don't feel it yet. I'm comfortable. But I also wonder why sometimes I have this descendants 2? Was it? And I do acknowledge that sometimes me not acknowledging, it tends to create mom is calm in my life. But the thing I see that makes me more comfortable about. It is sometimes feeling like people expect you to bring, for example, of sudden weight with you that even if you say that."
"I was just going to see if I was just going to say. Yeah, I think naturally I supposed to and I always just like and welcome to being an underdog and under selling. Yeah, but I mean, I don't want to sound like I'm grateful and I also do want to acknowledge that like really is just, I mean, not not to discredit like everybody loves somebody sometimes feel like I don't, it's not a big deal. That is an iPhone people who fight them feel like running like huge companies. Are you, if you're a part of something so much bigger, you know, it's like to me what I do on January, I feel shameful because sometimes I feel like, I'm so thankful you to be here. And I'm like, what, what if I can't bring, you know, if I can bring you say,"
"Sometimes also maybe people like him to see you only as then, you know, and that's where I start to feel uncomfortable, but I think the amount of light infant you having like, friends, Instagram, use, I guess influence for I mean what right, you are very vocal about issues that matter to you and I think that it is an image that you know that I do want to review that even though I know like that might have some good on the people who follow me."
"Uncomfortable. Sometimes I get talking about stuff like that but not anymore because like, I'm so used to sharing and my job is to share as my life. And and the dissonant I felt for so long was because like me to stop at fault for me, was like half the better than music, right? Because it's like Joel, you can't let you know but then that I would feel so crappy because every time you go down and I had to talk about it because I had no choice like it. It was the only thing I was thinking about the only thing that, you know, that was consuming my life and I'm glad I did because that that made me feel so much better."
"I have this cool down my phone died, and it's called, This is why. And I screenshot every time someone thanks me for talking about about something, because just to remind myself like, you know, but every time I I share something after that."
"Vesselfinder. I mean as an experimental if you can begin detection that way to be like Oh, I'm XM exploring vulnerability and what that means but I think what I learned also was to not be so precious about the things that you've done in your life, like for example, even if like I message Lee like screw up,"
"So be a lot of the men that live in just keep improving and just learn from it, you know, you are not as good as they say that you are and you're not as bad as they say, you are. Just with. Everyone is like how they say. You got your selfies, on your intention and others on your action, which is just everyone, really dumb things onstage. You know, I've done things an interview that I used to also, hold a lot of like Sheen from that place right now. I see something you didn't do, you know, if I can get it on the podcast."
"Correctness as well, which I also am trying to understand exactly where it should be, because I don't know where I send you like, you know, I like again, overprotective parent is not healthy in general. The fact that we are just talking about it and thinking about it is enough and everything, if, you know, Terrell like this is cut called a fool. And basically, like the, the kite represents this guy, who's kind of just like almost walking off a cliff, but being very happy and it's not a negative sentiment. It just means that you are willfully, Exploring Life, and that kind of just how I choose to view things because I can also be quiet the overprotective parent."
"But I rather heads-up see where this takes us from falling a lot, you know, and I'm still learning how to fully adopted into mice. Try it like, for example, of last time you fold a city. I'm not going to try again cuz I don't want to fall then now I just fall and get up and see beautiful name of my wife, it off. It's okay. And I think now I'm at a point where I'm trying to remind myself that I am actively making this choice. And as long as you choose it, then we can say anything. Then you just go and do it. So, I mean, that's a combination between the two voices in my head. So when the vanishing poop hat comes out in like who, get scared anxious and then i a s d adult also have to come in and is okay, and you made this choice and you made it by thinking through it. And this is a conscious decision as an adult. Does that mean?"
"Open for nothing. Like why you going to change my? But it's not about that. Is like the fact that there is a voice is enough because they needs to always be something pushing back again so that we can maintain some kind of Aquila Graham as of now. I still don't know really where I said and yes, sometimes my life where I have the emotional capacity to came off and it sometimes I just can't and that's fine too. Like I don't have to be out there. Everyday life will staying cuz I haven't posted in awhile because genuinely, I'm think I'm trying to figure out again what, where I want to stand on certain things and I'm still learning. But women are 80% that she meets, right. They all think that they are weird and these some of them might not be able to love themselves and I think of anything just love yourself, I guess."
"Once you have the confidence and the compassion, there's really nothing that you can do in your capacity. And I mean, it's just that most of the time we are out. So just stop it is. I don't know. I don't know if you do that too, but it's like an instinct that comes out that you just selfie it because I don't know why, because right light is it's like it's meant to protect you from hurting yourself. You can love yourself and not be self-serving. You can love yourself and not be selfish. You can't love yourself. And equally love others. Just as much because like the idea of self-love is so often met with like Eagle ISM, but is very, very distinctly different women. Often find it more difficult to put themselves."
"I think upon reflection. I like sitting with some friends having conversations that, I don't think I'm good enough to Frances to ask for, always, for instance, like 1 something to be able to see that I want to do this. Yeah, even the fact that we always apologizing, always afraid to take up space. It's it's a human thing, everybody experiences it. But the only person that can really fix it is all cells for us. Like we understood that, maybe that's why I also take breaks because I need to remind myself. Every time I am on my way. I feel like I can eat that kind of solidarity. But it's when we got into the meeting forces that stand against that, you'll Waltz and kept keeps getting broken down, right? Just keep sending the album."
"Then we have the power to speak all truth into existence. So whether that be self-love, you know, whether that be friendship or whether that be sexual Wellness, the things that we talked about and continuously talk about become real and we have that power if not anything else."

Like right now is an exclusive thought that I was never imagined in just 5 months ago. At this individual could have been, like, I would have never imagined be out of a job that I've been in for 18 years and I still have it. But, oh my God, we were actually going to touch on embarrassing health conditions and you actually went on body and soul recently to talk about hyperhidrosis to tell us more about that. What was that?"
"An accessory switch to some of us. Some of those with high acceptance rates on your armpits, right out. Thankfully iTunes, some of the soles of the feet which I don't but I do have it on my hands. I don't have it right now. So when I was growing up, I think I had like a little bits of it when I was in the lowest. Check my TV, blew up when I was in my opposite, the school work. I would have not just like a moist pound."
"The water as I thought. Is it something that I'm nervous about? You could be right there. I said it, was it myself and installation and I think I got really upset about the situation and I hit eighteen. I will always remember when I was in my gym Hall and there was a couple of people and I had my credit people, right? I actually asked for extra a wet of papers that I really wanted to just do my exam, of course, because you see something friendsgiving, you looks when you used to date or something before you got married, right? Then hold hands and all that."
"I ain't really hard to believe by as I was getting like over in my early Twenties. That was kind of what was played on my mind going out. And then I'm married. The first, my first boyfriend is my husband right now. One of the things that made me feel like he is the one word. I don't think it was a casualty was for work. I can hold of people cuz I really would have been okay, it's really wet."

Nobody said you send me glove. Like cute cartoon ones. Oh my God. I own this when she was very young and older. So I didn't have it at the Icebreaker. I'm just so exhausted as a minor issue.
"I don't understand. And I think one of the many mental issues that we talked about that, we would have known about hyperhidrosis, is I have never spoken about it. I keep my hands. Yeah, because for me, right, I don't say it at all on your face."
"The face of my face. What is the normal Record split, right?"
I got the vaccine. I started dripping sweat from my armpits. It was tripping. I don't know.

So it absorbs, everything, and it still feels nice to you, kids. Like my new thing. How did it happen?"
"I do nothing because I felt that was when I was really young cuz I was holding my pee but that was the only time I had it.

"You bet against the same, going to be defined by your house, when women refused to seek treatment, because they're embarrassed to even talk about it. Like, when I had yeast infection for the first time. I didn't understand why she should, I just felt embarrassed, but then, when I finally told her she was like, okay, let's go to the gynae, get you some medication and that was it, as a young teen, someone trust that you can talk to an aunt and older friend all the sister, and it was the first time I go is infection. I went to see a doctor. It was a lady or female. The next time I got it. I knew I had to see a doctor because it wouldn't piss. He will is owned by younique medication for that for sure. And then they only had a male doctor there at the clinic and I was so desperate to just get it treated right outside. Whatever."
"Let's just get on with it. You can just get over the awkward part is all in your mind. As you are. I think if you like all you feel like my mean judge for it and things like that, but honestly when you see the doctor, I think they see way too many people that you got. When you have to spend I have to check my, my first one was so I had to get over there. Yeah, but my second was also a meal and then ya, ya health issues that we shouldn't ignore. I think this is very important in a 2015, study from UK foundation's ovarian, cancer action found that almost half of women, 18 to 24 are scared of"
Intimate examinations and two-thirds of women with too embarrassed to even say the word vagina vagina like a medical term.

They have a pet names for it like, but like my birthday is but I will use a special and educating them about the body right after the video yet. No, one can touch it. No one can see it. I see no people who can see it and you cannot specifically, you should teach kids like the actual name of it because they know it's called."
"Tell you, and that lesson will be scared as well as online. I don't know what the right now. They have like no Roblox online, your Minecraft Ross, exactly infection that affects three out of four women. There's also excessive hair growth because yeah, so could be a bigger problem is, what would be active, right? I probably eat small reflected on your face black people, hairstyle for a lady because I can hide it. But what would it? Cause a man would be things that people can see that on your hands on your face. I have a, I have a friend who have a hairy hands."
"Let me know when it's 5:45 and every single time and he goes out earlier. I stopped seeing again. What media has portrayed what women should look like. What attractive woman has? We just clean skin. No hair and nothing. Not even like a little B, B hair, like headless body. All over. Please remember, conscious of all the hair on my knuckles."
"I feel like people can see what I never thought of it when I was young. So I try to shoot or whatever. It's going to be a close up of my hand. I don't know. I just feel a bit embarrassed about it. I will never thought it's a big deal. I own I think is the only thing is a big deal when you have it and when you fix sticky on it, this may be caused by hypoactive, sexual desire disorder, hsdd according to health line for women with this often have partners that they love the enjoy but they often report feeling nothing or feeling like numb. That is regrettable, but they can baby since he could arise from a number of factors, right? Including psychological physical hormonal and stuff. That's happened to me."
"We have this, I know, but it should have something like this. Is it like a Perpetual thing or is it can I come and go like to? And I think I can come and go, chill desire disorder where you love your partner, but sometimes you just do nothing, but I feel like it could be because you have been together for a long time."
"A psychological thing cuz I had depression last time and anxiety right now. Lifelong journey like to face paint. A fact that you don't understand. Okay? Depression could actually be a very long lasting thing involves, so many things in order, if it happens from one in that six months does, what I feel. Let me play spice things up."
"Spotting between periods that I don't think so, but I know, right? I think we have any lucky. Indecent. What are you doing? I have one time when I was coming here for a recording. I don't know where I thought I was pregnant or something. Why would you leave? Occasional spotting can be harmless. But that happens too often. Then you definitely want to get that checked out. Okay. I'm going right now to see if your spotting without a reason, you don't know what it is that you could actually be STI. You could be ovarian cancer. It could be PCOS as well."
"Yeah, you are anything but it's always better to be safe. And there's also you don't when it comes to our nipples. Have you guys ever experienced nipple discharge for women that has ever given birth? Or never? I think, in general, me me. If I was sure, I heard about this and I heard about the women, with inverted nipples are very difficult to breastfeed your child. And so they blame themselves. Like, why isn't he wasn't he, let you on it as well."
"Not being is a protruding protruding. I think it's okay. It's more like a it doesn't pop up. Yeah, okay, okay."
"I invited all. This could be a sign of breast cancer. Inverted nipple nipple nipple, Russia's according to the National Cancer Institute. Did the inverted nipple, whether it's like we were like that, all three have been halfway with our bodies to change. All of a sudden like allergies happen rather than a sign of absurd, deposited problems. Don't even know, Wendy about to breast feed, our children of this problem, really a good, or a good person that helps to massage you. Like to chew, you know, you can do it. Oh my God, he's a party. I think we all should take more initiative. Like, I didn't read about it because it didn't bother me."
"So I can read about it on the compassionate about the screw is going, okay, but that was going to be a few conditions that affect men. What does women like we mention? He's infection. UTI. Just not right. So yeah, I think so embarrassing topics that they don't want to talk about. Can involve the receding hairline transplant from the pool."
"So yeah, so the whole world will be able to see that you have gotten it and let me know what a girl back love, but she didn't see why they happen. If I think another thing that is something embarrassing that men tend to not want to talk about is directions. So just can't get it. Go in, I mean about it, right? When you are finally in bed and find it."
"Ain't happening. Captain. No, no, no, no, no, no, not happening. But I guess guys, pull up, right in like the performer or the little friend like sexual activity. And how do you like as a kid in the future, smoking, diabetes drug consumption? It could be many different reasons, Viagra. And then some people take too much Viagra and it doesn't go down."
"Too long and it can be quite as soon as you eat and even lead to permanent importance in which Rita in time the privates right yet, but I think it's devastating. It really has got to go to the doctor for himself, but it could be a bigger problem. It is no big deal. But like you said, what are your expectations? Like? What are you guys discussing about? Like if you would have your own, the same picture of not having babies and then fine but if she wants a baby and you say yes, and she doesn't know that for me that you can. I think that is the trash out in the beginning of the relationship and so embarrassing. It is you have to because it's to see each other's life history."
"You and your friends, whether they do health checks together together as a couple to check whether or not to prove it to anyone that I'm okay, or whatever. It's for my own health. He's already oddest. Technician for Dish TV."
"It's us that we have no time to get with you about health check-up mute. You never know. We could save a life. You know, that, you know, that phone line, y means. And I think it happens to a lot of teen boys as well because they're going through puberty, right after experiencing these things for the first time. So that could be dangerous as well. You could have impregnated. Someone with premature ejaculation, talk to talk about, but definitely needs to be checked out with a doctor. If you experiencing it, that sounds worrying already talked about this."
"See that, you need to see this thing. Right? Like she would tell this guy that she met this guy and she bleed through what?"
"You like it was a, what do you mean? What do you mean, man? Be too? And he said that when you don't lose my semen this blood inside and he thought it was normal or he didn't know he's going to do without you is a note from producer and he didn't know it's been years. I hope he's okay. Now, let us know that you are. Okay. Yeah, okay, for you girls, man boobs, when a man's chest resembles, a woman's breast using an embarrassing."
"When boobs like it ready should have read. That's the reason why I should be looking at your man books right now, as I'm talking to you right now. Why should you be looking at my boobs objectification, you know, I do the same thing. I guess if they have a sheet over it and there's no problem at all. I don't really care much about it. That's not okay. If I put some flat chested women, nothing at all. Like the kind of that kind of"
On the one. I have so much attitude.
"I know when you don't have a look at Ya understand. Yeah, I seen something I left for you. Are you guys have to go through some shit as well?

"I need the around, check out themselves. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So before we end of this episode, what are some of your thoughts, two people can do what you want to say to people who don't want to see a doctor because they embarrassed about some of the health conditions, I think today, if anything else, as well as at the doctor really has no issue with you, it's you and you you and you like right in so much more bodies, too much money to get bodies or whatever and Anthony's and visit with you and help you out. And I, for me, my issue is to just stop making excuses. If they've no time as always. I have no time did the kids activities, my work. I'm too busy with stop it. I can just 1 Day 2 hours for the time I get to the clinic and then they were just, you know, email is results that fast."
"I just got to get my calendar and just go for it. I think I'll do well, if you know, all the family, all the love in the world. Your health is still in most important. You need to take care of yourself before you take care of your whole family.

And if I know what you're experiencing, an embarrassed to see a male doctor, I mean, they're plenty of feeling about this. And then, this is the frequency that you wouldn't be doing his share of friends with the frequency of your problem today, so they can be really arrested and then he saw a problem. It could lead to a bigger thing till I get it checked, you know what to do and brush it off. And if you're embarrassed to talk about, if your friends, for example, although we don't see a reason why you should be, but if you are, at least, you shouldn't be embarrassed with doctors. Cuz honestly, I feel like they're too tired. We have no time to make judgments on. You seen it all."
"You know, the longer it goes on for your medical cost to go up because they get serious, right? And also want to appeal to everyone on the flip side of it. If you are not facing, these problems have empathy, you don't have kindness and understanding for the people that are fully agree.

Wait, I, where was I getting? Or understanding of Life? What life should be like for a relationship to be? Like, what will my future be like something? That was like,"
I thought was predestined for married. But what is your take away in that? I am so long and then
"I wouldn't say you are precious to get married.

I thought this, or if you would like this happen and it was so many kind of assumptions in life."
"Just a lot of misunderstanding, spot and clear, and I guess I don't think so. I realize that I really hadn't been communicating and it wasn't brought up to me by by another friend that she felt like if I had problems with the ex, I wouldn't actually talk to them. Sharing issues was just me, sharing, any issues that you have to cause no relationship. If I go to issues in French's, I will bring us another famous situation."
"I realize that situation, I don't see the issues and then I guess I was so excited when I realized, I didn't know it's a lot more about making sure my car and I think like a big deal about everything. So even if you're upset about something, it's not about expecting about it is really about"

"You mean like my age? All I want in life to kind of like be dating in like finding a boyfriend and settle until you find somebody to spend time with you.

So I'm waiting for the buy know that. That's not always the case for everybody. That's a lot of things while I owe, you know, I feel like some of the expectations umbrella."

And all of this is for science, so that we can study it more in the future. Because it doesn't rot or even for, I just want people to appreciate it. Do you have friends or family members? Who disapprove of your work? All my friends and family are actually super supportive. My mom would sometimes. Stop pick up, big animals for me, and my friends were actually send me pictures, or you were the locations of some roadkill. Actually. They learned a lot more about animal parts from what I do as well. How much do you actually learn from this business? I only started going, show for the past one month. Definitely more than 2K. But it also depends on the commissioned pieces that I get because the chemicals are actually very expensive and inaccessible. And of course, you have to have a studio or alive. So all"
"Don't think I can do pretty much costly and materials are definitely not cheap. What would you do? If you suspected that a client, had a quiet and animal. Chewy Regal means in Singapore here. I will government checks. I lost things."
"I do not deal with any endangered animals, unless it is contracted by the government for example to preserve. Perhaps add a animal that passed on from the zoo. It is impossible for the member of the public to actually get an animal such as a tiger, a flamingo. And if I do get one, the first thing I do is actually to notify the authorities to check if they actually have the legal documents to keep the animal. What was the weirdest reason someone gave to preserve an animal? So far, there is no real reason."
Then you have to draw a dick.
"Oh my God. Me make this sounds of this animals coil birthday, very annoying. But you know that you here every morning. It's in my head, but I don't really remember how they sound like."
I remember cucumba.
"sea lion, I think they going to be like"
"and a foxy, they do some sort of weird laugh like"
"I'm not good at this. Is there something you're morally disagree with about your job? Before this. I was assigned as a still, a scientist and a researcher, in the name of science. We actually sacrifice and euthanize. A lot of little animals, you know, that we do tests on and that is something that I do not agree with that, is something that I hold onto in Blackville. Texted me, a note, that there is no killing at all. So, everything must be adequately sauce. That's a, if you're a member of a public, you want me to preserve a cat, but if you purposely harmed, the cat or even kill the cat, I will not take it. What are some of the biggest misconceptions regarding Taxidermy. One of the biggest misconception about taxi to me is that it revolves around black magic and Witchcraft which is entirely false because Taxidermy is a branch of science. For example, like the London Museum, the natural history, museums all over the world. They just text me, the need to preserve some animals that are extinct."
"Bring it back to study even up till now. You can still see the specimens around. How does working on dead animals influence your values and your perspective of the natural world. I love emotional questions right here. I got you. When I get, like a kisses. Are you been dating sites? Because they have such a short life span just like here in Singapore, the least two weeks plus, or even three weeks Beyond from an A, to a cocoon. And once they emerge from the Cocoon, out of you pay for a minimum of three hours, and a maximum of seven days to decide very magnificent creature. You actually learn how to appreciate life, more compared to human beings. We actually live around like 60 to 80, but for inside, everything moved so fast. Paced and a lot of people here in Singapore, because in such an urban jungle, no one actually got to appreciate that because most of them are nocturnal and they are in the results. So we have to appreciate the Nitro."

"What about your job that keeps you going? It is my a man for has a personal goal to make things beautiful again. And especially when they are dead and rotten, people don't appreciate them, you know. In that form. For example, if you see a skull, you will never think that I actually have to manually. Skinit they go to II's the brains, you know, and everything that's inside. But what they said is that, I owe this girl is really beautiful. Sweetie will preserve. It doesn't stink. And I am actually very curious what animal this is. So that is my goal to make people curious to make people want to learn more about the animals. Never have I ever Frozen an animal and forgot about it. Oh, no, no, no. No, it is always in the back of my mind. That says that, you haven't resolved this yet, because you kind of fries and animal for too long, or do you have freezer burn? So, when please open happens, you can't print of it well anymore."

"Never have I mistaken or freezes animal for a living animal. When I was younger, you know, are you go for Ripley's, Believe it or not? And you have all those animals behind the case, and I do get her father. Is this a living one? Or is this a prince of the one? You can actually mistaken a piece of animal for a living? One has been people to come to my studio, when it's in the rabbit. You'll be okay with that a real rabbit. You know, I said a real butterfly."
"Telltale sign of something that is true. So I would say go for the ice, pick up the ice. You can never replicate the hundred percent to how it looks like. When it's a life. You don't have a soul in them. We always use glass eyes or criticize or even be nice to replace the animals eyes. And that is one thing that we can have it because you know, you have that round eyeballs, but when you freeze over and chemicals is all got shrunk in at you want to go real anymore?"

"Hi, welcome back to something private. It's a special episode by the music, right?"
"You know, the guys that friend want to hold, you have over policies, Tampa strip."
"Videos of a brand called tulips and invited us to join them on Sunday to Mission. Did you guys about me. That's right. I'm talking about talking about, it was so cute and you let her with her all the time and cranberry juice in. There is a big part in our overall health and well-being. So, how do we keep our little sister in a five-part miniseries? Every last Wednesday of the month?"
"How did Applejack, Heidi Cole? We have bought so I don't need to feel that way sometimes, but I need to talk to Jesse."
"What is a message in Syria and Iran and generally it's a it's a space to deal with sexual health and illness. Has anything to do with the genitals, be it for men women and all them between who we offer that kind of time and space through onrush console, to be able to fully acity, and he know what's going on with your sexual experiences. Could there be something physical going on? The background? Something for Moto going on in the background examination of structures, like the Volvo. And often, people don't know much about what we find in textbook. That's what we learn about in school."
What we call it. I don't know. People think I painted that but I didn't. I wish I had a great painting skills. I would have signed up my name.
"Let's bring down. I guess like the 5th or the structure is right beside me in the clinic. So I don't make it introduces itself to my patients. The first thing that they look at men or women, when they come in to the clinic for men, often get distracted and women often. Do you know, it's like open up. This thing's already glaring at them, each one of us to be on one of this but I bet with you, yours is not going to look like this. Mine's not going to look like this. This is just a very simplistic diagrammatic approached so that we can go ahead and say hey this is what to say something. That is this that has got this name, take me to the Volvo image of what between your legs."
"A graphic representation of what it look like. There is so much variability with the vulva, but you could match yours up to something like this. If you're trying to identify, you know, what a different parts of the evolved, as I like to call it the flashy, the fleshy bits. Yes. I call it because everything in the middle and the lips is when you get a pubic hair grow. When you pop the lips, you see little bit too. Fleshy. Pink tissue on the inside. It looks like there is more delicate than the regular. You get me outside. Then this year the lips included makes your entire border to this whole area with everything and encompasses is the vulva the right at the top."
"I also like to use this like I think I like that in a teardrop shape and I say, you know, this is a little tear drop and your body was kind of like a teardrop. You feel from the tip and you write it down. If you feel a little help, that's the kids missed. So it's not the clitoris clitoris. Disable. What you feel, is the hood, you lift, the hood of the five big. Lots of times in some women, the most women. You don't find it so prominent, so big. But the saddle valve underneath that, little knob. Now, what's a misleading? What? People don't know why things? No, more and more now about this because this is a space in the time you were talking about that, the female genital Anatomy is that this is just the top of the peak of it. The rest of the children, stop to actually runs underneath invisible to our eyes. We can't see it for the rest of the structure is all internal and extend store in centimeters."
"But you just see the peak of it. So then below that, you just want to get past that road. Bombardier, running your fingers down a crossed it then you hit the Beast like a little depression. You come to a speech with everything starts to feel a little bit and then you fall into this area where you go? Okay, feels a bit more sensitive face in that area every year when it down all the way through, when you get caught on the hammer, you feel like, you know, that is a spot Advanced. I will enter the opening of my vagina, maybe take a look at this diagram. You'll see a lot of these issues, like what some of these leftover leftover of your hymen."
"All of us still have evidence of a hymen. There is not a hundred percent, but it's just regressed back. All you need to do is just sit around with it and you can you find you find an entrance has an opening it. So people often doing fine, diagrams like this very helpful because then the expectation is said that this is what this is what my look like. I'm struggling to find something like this because I still always go by feel, you know, kind of where what is a go by feel and then apply pressure and know what that feels like. And you know, when you're at the bottom of your ball, that is a little, a little bit ly mentioned at the South episode people, mix it up and they call it the vagina, but you mentioned that, you know, this is inside the vagina. Why is it important?"
Familiar and I use AccuWeather.
"It's just like, you know, how we all want to be called by what we're doing. As I think that's as basic as that, right. You don't want you know, what you want to be addressed. And so that when you mentioned something this Clarity and who exactly what you were talking about and you know exactly what you're talkin about. The some people will come to us and say he jumped her. My my vagina is very dry."
"And by definition vagina is the tube. Write the canal and I'm trying to see if you can try on the outside. I don't know. I mean, I don't feel that Volvo is a medical term. It shouldn't be. It should be a comment on that. We should start addressing this area is Volvo, a different teacher, simple life, physical appearance, just before puberty happen. Dozens recessions in the brain goes, ding, ding, ding. Let's manufactures of estrogen. So estrogen, being the female hormones. Now start to have it into a"
"The vulva tends to happen in women and girls who are going through puberty and Alternate the process already started and that the highwomen starts to thicken up. And that's the little tissues that surround the vagina and entrance that could be some vagina discharges that are starting to be a producer. And there's also another hormone, progesterone, another female hormone, testing producing these to sort of disease to humans. Walk in sync with each other and if they work in sync with each other and production start to increase gradually over time, the hair over the lady. I was just a fat lip stop to become the sticker and Kalia discharges, or something that women start to recognize because this Negros about to recognize it on their underwear. As the vagina, starts to hydrate, sell the cervix and uterus. Organ start to produce more mucus and they produce something that we call Germany vagina discharge."
"Meetup is produced by that. You just love extended. Of time on Monday. I've been seeing a lot of research on this particular episode and yeah, like the lips of the vulva."
"Coming mall explorative and you are engaging with other individuals who might visualize have their own personal perception of what their bodies like, including the less often it is because of what social norms are you. And I going to remove it is also often less. So, because male partner, another female partner has commented about the state of the look of all the periods of the vulgar. Women do have this perception of their own bodies. And I'm on the 60 satisfaction. They get his Austin Cole related to how well, they perceive to be so many. Women are removing pubic hair mini because it just don't like the appearance of this and that area. And it's"
"They don't do that hygiene. They don't feel they can wear certain types of outfits or particular type of underwear. So they make these decisions based on very, very personal preferences rather than somebody else's preference or this is in style. This is in fashion. So I'll go ahead and do it. So, when we make decisions like that, it's because of a personal preference, talking about what you've mentioned, like trimming down the size of the late lady has all the parts that were talking about is a labia minora, the smaller lips, the ones that are mentioned, can open up like a butterfly. And now there are two different groups of women. I suppose our and in some cases there is we classify the labia. Minora hide. Now, what in the world,"
"I should be your lady. Lenora is quite big. You just going to die outside. Who is an owner of ladies. That is that large. It's going to suffer from abrasion is going to suffer from alteration. They feel that they have to do a tack fold the labia, minora up, tuck it into their big lips, so that they can feel comfortable across the D. And sometimes it creates a little bit more of a camel. Toe than you would like, when you are very tight of clothing is not an aesthetically pleasing appearance to themselves. Women often. Don't worry what they might look like to others in the mirror. They don't appreciate that. So there is a group of women who will become a request a labiaplasty. So that's the name of the procedure. That is used to reduce the size of the lady."
"So that we have a mess in. There is another group of women who are not suffering from discomfort from having a larger lady has, but they are paying a lot of attention to their genitalia and a lot of women stop paying a lot of attention to the sectionals with confidence, but we do that to ourselves. We want to see yourself in the aesthetic procedures that might be done to a TV."
"And when it doesn't fall in that category, we think that it is not quite normal, but I can mention there is no standard of normal for the labia. Stevens us, like the inside of your vagina is there is really very interesting that you said that because if you have many things. You might get loose. But who is that good for? And who is that bad for? Are we talkin from a male perspective or the penetrators effective? What can you feed? It? Sounds like this is not good enough. You're not going to get to lose from having multiple sexual encounters."
"If you've had injury to your pelvic floor, muscles muscles, that support the vagina, right? They hold them in your scaffold collapsed and then your sister and then that can happen in pregnancy. You know, what happens during childbirth a little bit of a traumatic experience the vagina. A little bit of the pelvic floor can be loosened his concert events amount of stretching and the delivery."
"It tightens up. Will it bring you back to your original? No, bring you back, maybe about 80% happens to the vulva. You know, she experiences child, but I think the only thing that opens up and then sometimes doesn't come between that has quite a few changes. So, I have you seen a pregnant woman's belly."
"The skinniest rated as one of the change. Theirs is docking line, right down the middle and it extends well below the belly button sometimes, and that's called Linea, nigra. So during pregnancy because of this month, and in the other sort of homeless to increase your production of pigment melanin, right in your body do during pregnancy. A lot of women tend to pick me up a little bit more homogenous darkening, you know, so you can get, you can get some dr. As well, even find that the inner thighs start to get DACA the labia majora, that's to get DACA and they finally get to Bazaar online."
"So that's one of the changes of all the way through during pregnancy and always go away completely. So that the line on the belly of them disappear, and it takes months for that to completely clear away, women find that the valve, the valve, adopt me the lips talking, and the inner thighs, it reduces intensity, but it seems to stay even after delivery of this, one of the team's, another changes that some women go through and Caucasian women or women. Arrested in Origins. You have a higher risk of things that blood clot. It's the third trimester of their pregnancy stages of their pregnancy and soon after delivery."
"Have you got a varicose vein varicose veins in your legs? A lot of us who have jobs where we stand a lot of Leavin right up at the level of your labia experience. Very close being on the Olivia and you will see this other patents on the labia. So, these are some of the changes besides the color becoming more intense becoming darker. So many minutes do varicose veins on the labia majora and then of course, I will make things different types of discharges. So the discharge might feel a little bit more intense than might be increased risk of vaginal infection."
"Pregnancy at 12 to appear a little bit more, the environment in the vagina. And he goes through. Yes. There is a baby existing that Canal. It is not just your vagina that expands with the rest of the body accommodates as well work together with the doctors that also expand. And then the vagina also go through a process that tells you how tenacious?"
"And then all you suffer is a tear that is across the perineum, which is the area. You identify the area between the vagina and the anus. And that's quite a lot of tissues my buddy, just like all the purpose of life is a woman because she has been like a man request for the whole wide world."
"I thought I knew I should not be, it should not be something that the doctor consult the the partner and go ahead. And and by the way, you know, it's not a decision that you make a dr. Shouldn't be down. There should be a proper fall of a system and Minnie before delivery that could be easy questions. That could be asked to the woman a woman and she could address to you if she was like, you know, I don't quite feel the grip or I feel like I have to force it, like, 12:30 grip or squeeze. My toe has filled my husband's penis penetrating, but I don't feel good. What's important is what she feels because she's the person who's going to be penetrated. So addressing her concerns are important."
"And if she says that, you know, I feel like it's already quite lose. I don't have a good sensation of the then the conversation could open up at least it. Would you like us to also perform a little bit before you? Then? She makes the original."

"I didn't like the physical changes, a lot of us are very reasonable and let me see what my body is like. Posting that appearance of my vulva is now still acceptable. And if this is an ongoing issue, then of course, you know, it is very important to have this looked at on the lower part of your abdomen and that could indicate things I can, we might be at higher risk of having pain during sex."
"Who is might be indicated, something else. Interesting."
"Minotaurs is one of those things that he asked quite suddenly, isn't it? Is like the Machinery is working and then bang, the whole ones that we have grown. So, exhausted, too, from you. Just what? Mine? 10-12 all the way up to 50 is every digit of menopause is about 52."
"And during menopause suddenly decides that he doesn't crash 20 per-cent of what it really diminishes quite suddenly. And like, in men they don't go through menopause like we do they have something called and record and has declined by 1% every year after the age of 50, but for us it's like, you know, so it just isn't, you know, one day you will see the next in in the next couple of weeks or months. You're not. Okay. You just turned two different person. Physically, you're a different person hormonal and a buddy that expected to cope with that changed and part. And parcel of that comes with Genius of the Volvo. Because the Volga is very or Reliance on stimulation by the world."
"Cooking supper collagen going to. They're so what we met before menopause. There's a decline, right? Find that the outer appearance of the vulva. It's not to change by saggy appearance of the labia. It's like somebody sleep at the media. They are all the balloons and all you're left with is this sagging skin that wrinkles up. So that's one of the first few changes. So women will find that. You know, I used to be spoiled these nice folks. I can I can see them like at the entrance of my vagina. I see this old and you lose the 40, all start to straighten out the, you lose what we called the Rudy which is within the vagina. You lose that as well. As the other thing is a s dryness. What happens in the tissues."
"It's like as if you wash your face after using a really good soap to wash your face. And if so, who has a higher risk of something called lichen sclerosus. Where are the tissues in the Volvo area start to dry up and it's not the fuse, like one another and quite distinguished, where the TouchWiz is anymore. Where the, the labia minora is anymore. Everything is fusing into one another. And that's when it gets very uncomfortable for some of these women who suffer from Lichen in the oldest ages of your life. So emotional, or psychological issues."
Do mental health gets quite like quite a common thing that happens with that last can of stage in your life is very sad that this so-called last in your life.

"Things that women do do now is under the, the realm of a replacement therapy, you know, we replace the whole month that you might have. It is one of those things that women could see this suitable to take something like that, just to persist with menopause hormone levels. And now, of course Beneva, me know. So then suffer from some symptoms. So, you know, if you get rid of bility you get dryness to get refrigerate urine, tract infection after menopause. Menopause therapy would be an option for you. When you could. You could take something like that just to write through a little bit with a little bit more homeruns for another 10 years has very safe to take between ages 50 to 60 minutes, starting at 8:40, and then he carried on until the 6th."
So often we don't recommend it. Be on a t60. This is the date. What would be the right from the time? We start ministration right up to the 1550s? We have bad language. Issues. Issues because it means and ways of stopping birth control and then when you hit menopause the dress. But then you're faced with a new problem and we're in that face.
"I softened in our forties, with funny things are all great. You know, I want to start living living their incomes in the, the party pooper got menopause and that takes that away from you and it changes, you are no longer the person you were in your forties, you know, a brand new for some of the better version of you, but you're a different person because now you're a person riding on Lissa and complain of women complain of being dry, did the HTC or a physical dryness of sensitivity and then cannot even begin to engage in activities, like masturbation sexual intercourse with your partner."
"Live Journey around the world, take our time, and our retirement, and start living. And I think a lot of the times that you living happens in that time frame, a lot of us at work all day. We work our day. I picked up my 50 Cent going through my second divorce, living the time of my life and I'll be very depressed. If these are my vivit systems into each other, like finding new love in a later stage of your life. So I seen a couple of the few women in my tunic who have approached us to aesthetically change the appearance of the evolved version if you dig into the story."
"Finding out who the procedure like, this is so critical. And many of these women who've been through divorces, a relationship that is unhealthy for them. They are in their forties. And then again, yeah, I can imagine, I'm struggling also because then you get very conscious of being absolutely in your naked state in front of another person you go. I'm not what I used to be. I'm not I haven't got my buddy that I had when I was in my twenties things. Look different. I'm seeing the changes of heed that has happened to my boss. Confident about this. I put myself out there and I don't want to be open to judgment. Although it might not be open spoken, Dutchman, but you need to be over think a few things, but it's a"
"Chicken of how we feel about our self D DOT physical changes and a hormonal changes. Like, I knew, this is what I can expect. As I entered this phase of my life. I have identified the LOL. I recognized something has changed about me attention from a professional, and go. Can you help me? Address? Is this indeed, what? I think it is my Volvo's experiences change. I'm having dryness. I'm having more discharge. I'm having an infection or so. I think this is the key to getting repeat that urine. Tract infections. Why. And I purchase menopausal two years ago. And then we recognize that these are the issues. Then you can extend for the question."
"To whoever was beating with you with anything else. I can do to someone, who is time I get there. I'm sure there's other options that can help me prevent it. I have menopause. Is there a little hole in one that I can do? Something that I can insert into my vagina that helps you place the hormones there and rejuvenate that area for me. So I can keep getting this nuisance urine. Tract infection friend of Hurst."
"Essentially headlight recurring UTIs. She's a young woman like myself like something, but she's afraid to help cuz she wasn't sure if like UTIs would like to, she just did the infection."
"Not younger. Girls are hesitant about examined in in the office because somebody, and they feel they have to be at your Prime + proper in. The number of times. We've been walking to a clinic and then they will apologize. I just came from the gym. I mean, I understand that being courteous manners and maybe get that and thank you very much for him for me, but you don't have to be present when you come in because we have to be able to accept that. This is what it does look like."
"Begin to tell to adults when they are at their worst suffering from an infection and disease diagnosis because they don't feel like they can of food is a bit of a very low confidence around it and thinking that you and I might just disappear on its own. Yeah, every time every time I say the second something, all right."
"It's about the conversation for today. I might want to know, you know, for the purposes of the women, while listening to a podcast. Do you have any light caring about your vagina or something, you know, is if you realize that he'd be familiar like very familiar with what you are in those areas of your body to be familiar with your bow. You carry it with you day in and day out 24/7, you are expected. And you should know your body better than anybody else. There are many people in in a relationship, we expect of hotness to do. They have all of us have to give respect and attention and we don't think a it but we saying get to know it."
"Be explorative. It is not possible for you to hurt it through, simple exploration. Take a picture, look at it, when I find the greatest in common, with knowing where what is on your vulva is to feel it because when you feel a problem, when you see the symptom, when you feel something's not right, you can't exactly go. I don't feel comfortable in this area is exactly where I supposed to break something. It's just not right down there. So that way you're more educated in your able to relay a cross, your problem. Clearly, and therefore didn't get attention for that problem."
"So, exploration and being familiar with the two things out, season in all women should do. And it's about time. We feel proud of Alvarez. Just I'm into very proud of their penises. We should give it that kind of respect in this lifestyle, but I think it's really important to say. So,"

"I had somebody just came up to me while I was working and I and I do makeup as a career and I was doing for this celebrity and she said beside me during like a lunch break and she was like so good music. Look up and down. She's like, why are you making some become this fat?"
Valsartan.
"Oh, okay, when you were younger, how did you compare yourself to others?"
"Oh my gosh, I didn't compare myself to people. It was mostly my parents doing the comparing. It is not. My parents is always my friends for some reason. Like they said that they had the right to compare me to other people. That was one, comment. Got me. Like I kind of like hit me quite hot in a way because I was going through depression to that point. And I knew that I put on a significant amount of weight also, like, in my last year of secondary school, so I came right. He just kind of, like he said in front of the whole class, like, he's about you. I feel you, I feel you. I mean, like, I remember when I was, like, I had so many remotes when I was in school, but people they say, oh, like you need to lose weight. You can't even fit like to know the size and then like,"
I got to say not even just as friends but like Family itself pressurizing you to like lose weight than like you look so much prettier if you just choose a bit of weight and then you should come to a point where you accept things as they are.
"Have you ever been body shamed a lot when I go to work? I had somebody just came up to me while I was working and I and I do makeup as a career and I was doing for this celebrity and she sat beside me during like a lunch break and she was like, so that means you look up and down. She's like, what are you making some become? This fact and I was"
"I didn't know how to react bring back to sleep. I know how to react because I was just sitting there doing my own thing and tell me just comes and sit beside you. By the way. I was like doing her makeup. I don't think you realize that. I'm the makeup artist like, she's going to be on camera. And when I do all these press that for, for my camping, call the body Revenge. People still come up to me and tell me that the only reason why you should be fat. If you have hypothyroidism with this medical condition. Otherwise, you just from working obesity. I do a bit of modeling as well. Invite new & bold also, like the only reason I do that. Right? Because I, you know what, I grew up without having anyone or like a variety of a body shake as I just don't look at. So I want to put myself out there and let"
"If you do a certain way, it's fine. You can accept it now and then you learn how to be a better person from their sweat. The things that when I started doing that, right? The body shaming came in quite a bit because I will lose it with you. Just like, you do not like your photos are usually referred from behind and I was just like that in my boyfriend. Like I don't know if this is, what goes into body-shaming anymore because I like so, if I'm fat and ugly, like this, right means, I can also go and take photos."
"I mean, I think a lot of people online don't realize that they should think twice about things before they say or like to come in. What do your family and friends think about the shape of your body then versus now, I definitely know my family like especially my mom's side, right? Even though I haven't talked to her in years. There was a of time where she said, you know, you look so much better when you were younger. If only you knew how to control your diet. And if you only knew how to control like how much you exercise and things I did, but I knew I looked better last time, but I felt like shit but currently like, yeah, I do not understand that but I feel so much better about myself now. I mean, I got to stay like they can't do it just like every Auntie and Uncle will just come to you and tell you. Oh my God. The last time I saw you was so much more and then like"
"And I'll be like I said, what? I always tell them straight out. I should have been eating healthy and working out. This is the way I look to find me. The the always feel like it's okay to say whatever they can be as hot as possible. For some reason, I even begins in what was the meanest or the most absurd, you've heard about your body, post more risky like Miss, Kay photos. And also on my Instagram, one of them actually came into my DMs and said,"
"I don't understand why you're posting such photos. Is that you're doing it for attention and then you end up hating it. I'm not doing it just for myself, you know, I'm doing it to show people that you can play and you can still love yourself in situations where if someone comes to you and tells you something that breaks you you can either educate them and tell them exactly why that was offensive or you can just walk away and know that this person is not worth your time. Yeah."
"All right. What is the best thing you've done to your body? Good question. I don't know. What is cool because I really literally mentally and physically, you know what, ship in the size of it is because when I put on the way, I had a lot of stretch marks and to be honest, I really, really hate to distract myself. So because that it even came to a point where my dad commented, when he saw me changing, right? That he was like, oh my God, you thinking you are so much at all. So I think the best thing that I did to my body was actually getting all these that too. So so I know it's a way of feeling that he dated but I felt very pretty of, you know,"
"Nice online. A smaller size or like a screaming, girl. She is accepting it the way it is and listening to my boy. How do you like finding out what kind of food I can eat and not what kind of food I can eat and also like shopping for my size and I'm so late liberating. It just makes me feel so much more better as a person. That is. It's so great to know that you have your size exist and knowing that this is how close are supposed to look on you. When was the moment in time when you begin to assert yourself and the way your body looks, I'm going to start a bit on when I started hating myself a lot, which was when I was"
"13 years old, but in the age of"
"1819. I kind of finally accepted my body is slowly. I want to say that like, you know, suddenly I just felt like I woke up one day and I'll be like too much nonsense. No, I mean, when I was 19, I I went through so much to understand my body and see like what can I do to embrace this? And every day is going to live until now, even though I advocate for body neutrality and I tried to listen to other women stories and I'm not going to put up that follows image of saying that I wake up feeling good about myself or feeling. Okay. I have to put the effort to make myself feel good. Make myself feel like normal and not feel so very negative about the way I look, I love this question. Where do you see yourself in five years time?"
"If I'm not doing like posting this kind of photos online, right? I see myself, trying to join movements are like joining other people solar. I want to be able to like, put myself out there like, okay, even though I'm done posting photos on myself, at least I am able to, like, talk to people. Now, like I'm able to fully open up and I he I cannot understand the situation that you're going through, but I know the intensity of it. In five years time. I'm looking to really extend expend the body with a movement to schools. I think schools are pretty important, important thing in and I just want to"
talk about knowing exactly giving all these young girls and understanding of
"What your potential is in not in, or just putting yourself down all the time? And how do you deal with your insecurities in. You know, having these girls have a healthy and mindset of themselves."
What is your name?
What are you asking me? What I do?
You can just introduce yourself each other. Very nice to meet you.
"I had fun. So fun that it was intense, but fun, you know, it is nice to have someone to talk about issues like this. I mean, it's good. Like, I, I didn't know what you were doing before, and it's nice to know, like everything about you. It's amazing. It symbolize me to worry because you looking to spend this is all done online. Now, to be very, very real coming here and talking to a person face-to-face, like physically seeing and night talking. All right, everything in the World War II."
"Hello, my fellow friends of Hazel is Tremaine. I will come back to clarity's."
"What you a video where in PJ's again? Today, thank you so much for the video versions, you know, which one is ask because you have always been sitting in this exact very very, very important as we all know International women's day is coming real soon, hear of March."
"And so today we're going to discuss what place sexual harassment that sir, I ate. Okay. So here is a little content morning. Okay? Yes, that's right. Before we proceed, we want to tell you that this episode contains three counts of sexual harassment and that you should only proceed. If you're comfortable listening to them. It might be a bit sensitive and things like that, but I think it's important as well as any time if you're listening to this stories and what you hear is the what is happening to you. At the same time. We advise that you seek help from official or relevant authorities and this includes your bosses HR department. Will you walk the police if it's more serious like or I will send the send that that cases where the harassment comes from. Personals of Hyatt, are these ones, and it may get a little bit scary for you, but I will get more Into the Depths about that later. But if that's what you're currently experiencing a Wii device that you seek help from organizations such as a way. That's also sexually."
"Cast Center, sacc, who could advise you professionally on your situation? And you guys are the what comes on my mama?"
"So today will be discussing what place sexual harassment thoughts on this whole situation, right? Do you feel like this is a situation or this is a problem that you see in Singapore, Isaac. So I think we see overseas, we see and dramas, we see movies and I think we also hear about it happening in Singapore and we'll see in the music. Can you do think it's quite rampant? Maybe some we see somewhere here. So we don't. And I think that's also a spectrum of it. You know, some people, I think it's just what I do. You say it's okay because it's just what's never touch more. I think I'm very fortunate of all the places that I've worked at, right? You do to the surroundings or unbelief A+ to be working in such safe environment where this kind of thing. We don't happen. I do not know."
"somebody starts with, I"
"Do you like? Yeah, I think what has arrested right? Sometimes maybe you don't really see it or you don't really understand that. Hey, this is actually what we sexual harassment. Maybe you in a sense, you have internalized it and you have kind of reason with yourself. That old is normal. What does entertainment industry across all Industries. They stop at multiple forms of sex-based harassment in the workplace. And in the first nationally, representative survey on workplace sexual harassment. This was actually carried out by a research firm as well as a where they found it two and five workers in Singapore. Have been victims of unwelcome sexual advances of Remax in the office in the past 5. Yes. It's a very huge percentage. So that's kind of crazy. Right? But first, let's unpack what exactly is sexual harassment. Okay. So it is Define, is unwanted conduct of a sexual nature."
"How to conduct based on sex affecting the Dignity of women and men at work. So what does this include unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal, contacts? Hot Cheeto? What verbal or non-verbal kinds of forms of conduct can be considered a sexual harassment for men as well. As you know, it ranges from upskirt photo is, when I seen a lot of these, in the last couple of years, you've got stuck in, you got molestation. You've got kind of, like, using authority to threaten where that say, your boss threatens to fire you if you review anyting. But then again, that's not a good place to be at Rite all but some people I guess don't have a choice, you know, that bread for the family unwanted sexual advances from co-workers or clients. Keep calling the jest of names and loot jokes. It basically, if you feel uncomfortable, that is wrong."
"And sexual harassment comes in many different forms, it can happen to anyone. No matter what age you are, no matter if you wear long-sleeve. Short-sleeve short-sleeve also can happen to you and don't think I only happens when I put them in as well. Yeah. So I think this is a very interesting episode. That's right. I think now, it's kind of the right time to talk about this, you know, a couple of years ago. We had to hold me to move my right. And it really sparked, something huge in the world before that. I think a lot of people would have felt uncomfortable uncomfortable about these things uncomfortable side. I also feel like sometimes, especially when it's not straight people feel like there's a lot of pressure behind on things. So I think, rather than brush it aside as a joke, right? Which will not change anything in the future if you actually speak up about it, like, if someone said something to me that"
"Perhaps okay, know about sexual wrestling me to read this right before people. Usually laugh involving a comedian. Her name is Shahrukh Channel. Actually went on to kind of like a talk show. She was a gay and a former nominated Member of Parliament. Allegedly made a kind of a sexual, and belittling common. What can I do in the call before the interview? Right? They were just discussing. What you actually talked about sharra was asked by the host about a roast, kind of like pain that she was wearing on her shirt. And she actually say I put it on to distract from the patent on my top and then the whole said it would be more distracting if you only wearing that Rose and nothing else."
"Basically, that's what he meant line. Nothing else. So she felt incredibly uncomfortable and I still think she could have done in this situation. One. She could have just eaten it up and she chose to speak about it. And I think that what she did was the right choice. All right, but it doesn't mean that by speaking up your damage in your career, you know, until I think you made got more followers who didn't let us pick up because you did, you are exactly. But she got an email from Yahoo from the perpetrator and he acknowledged that he had made her feel uncomfortable and apologized. For some reason. I saw this post"
"I'm always quoting up. It was a post basically to educate people off and it was Daisy. So total I quoted this incident where this go. She had a ball that what can I see some inappropriate things about her and how do you make them? Explain it? So she said sorry, I don't get it."
"And then he had to explain, and once they have to explain, it's not funny, right? Yeah, it's embarrassing. But it's been able to, you mean, if you would have been like everyone should do that. Interesting experiences like that with someone's made a passing remark to you and you just felt so uncomfortable about it, but maybe you didn't say anything only positive. I can be more. So like actually sexual harassment / assault if if you're willing to Shayla. Okay, so I go for the cashier. My story first, this didn't happen in my workplace. Thankfully, it happened in this event. I was hosting years ago and boobies. I do remember there was no covet so everyone could attend like Vents and stuff, right? So a few fans came out in"
"Do you want to take photos with me? So of course, I was more than happy."
"This guy, he came out. He actually shows out at quite a few events and then he came out two years and I think I'm a bit more open-minded traditional conventional. So I actually put his hand. I think me and my soda or was it that my my elbow snapped the photo and then his hands just lie down."
"Casually, it was soaked. I do that. Even me at that point in time. I was thinking it was an accident. Or did he do that on purpose when he let him slide on, right? Brushed against my butt. Oh my goodness. I don't think it can be so cool if it's an accident, like, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do and he he, he okay. You don't do, you think intention to do that? No, on hindsight. Yes, definitely. So I actually spoke to a few other friends about this, and they told me that he actually has, like, kind of a reputation for doing this. Of course, a bad rep for doing this. So that's when I know he didn't do it by accident, and I wish that I could come out there."
"What the hell are you doing you guys? Because in that moment, I really wasn't sure. And I really don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill. You know, what if it really was an accident and it was only like a light brush and then he moved away. My goodness. Sofia. Sofia. And you wouldn't want to cause a scene not knowing this person. Did it on purpose or not, correct? And I think maybe perhaps it was few years ago. You were a bit younger as well. Now right? If they happen to you again. How do you make punching? And I really don't want this this kind of people doing this with other other girls."
"This is bad. But I was afraid of accusing him rolling. And I didn't want to make him feel bad for something. He did by accident. I'm still not sure whether or not it's an accident. But if you talk to other people and they also had the similar stories and buy, you know, kind of like sitting up against these wrong actions. I feel like these puppetry. This would be a bit more has it then please do the same thing to other people. So I mean no problem is the guy is listening as you better. Watch out watch out."
"But yeah, if you do the anyone else's you will find you so happen to you because this is something I still struggle with. Okay? Okay, I get inappropriate comments or messages from this mess on the daily. And I don't know if it's me being over-sensitive but it makes me uncomfortable. And as of late, I've been calling them out on a. I don't know if I should, what is the message. Okay, so I have stopped reading comments on Facebook because when I do, it's a bit and I have a friend of mine, a close friend of mine who has like hidden my Instagram from her page because she says, every time I post stuff she can do the colemans. I want to see them anymore."
"On WhatsApp because, you know, nobody else can see these people and it's like 121."
"Once I don't even look at him, okay, because these are people with like family photos as their profile picture and listening to fly. Right? Exactly. Did I get right? Would include things like he lost. He goes and leave. And then when I came back on the following Monday, I got a message from somebody who messages in daily life at the location and said, so good to hear you back. When are the apple of my eye is back? Okay, and look at things like that. Piss me off."
"Good in that top on that dress up like just a bit ago. But what if it was a lady saying all this would you have been disinfected? I don't think so, but imagine a guy. So what if it was your debt that say this. Exactly right? It's still getting all cute that's person and I know he's like double my age or with a child. A young child who is always like since pictures of or whatever. And then it just feels a bit sleazy to me. Okay, I understand. So you will call him out on everything. So on that day, I think maybe I was also be angsty Le and so I went on it and I said, oh, I think the same what to use if your wife."
"I like that little call you after that. He stopped exactly where he would like, and I'll let you know that correct because, you know, it will happen every day. So, my dad said, okay, let's do something about this. So I played it in a joking manner as well. And I said, oh, yeah."
"It's not really that I'm going for that. I'm not your cutie. Sorry. And then he texted it and said, oh, sorry."
"I think it was the right move on your part because you you didn't like schooled him or anything. You could have brushed it off as a joke, meet him get the idea that he's doing his. Oh, yeah. I don't even see this to my wife."
"For example, that I took a guy who caught a couple years ago."
"What, what did he do? Okay. So this was maybe four years ago, or maybe close to five years ago and at that time. So I used to do production. Okay? Okay. So we were walking on a drama. I wasn't in front of the screenshots back. Okay? Are the things that you have to do as well, right? Okay. So this has to do with location location scout thing. So I said I had to deal with it as well. Right? And because it was a long-running series it was on the hero has us. So it was going to be used for a long time ago. It was about 6 months and because I came in at 3. Size do felines, right? So this house at already be found by a full-time and the company? Okay. So when I came in, it was okay. We're going to use this house with this character just to get some"
"She said, Empty Apartment owned by this person. Okay, was this guy has three daughters and they don't know. Is that because he bought the house with his wife when she was alive and she had since passed, but because like, I think either one of them was not saying a party or something like that so he can't do anything in the house now because they bought the house and live that and then they did better life. So they moved out about another place. They moved out and see how old is Kasey? Kahne do anything with it. So it was ideal for filming. Right? But it is not occupied and because it was just left like that. So because we had to do stuff for the house, so that was okay as well. Okay, you want to do something song as like you reinstated?"
"And then, as we start filming in things like that, we still am at him. And at some point we still getting a lot of complaints from him. Okay, like he would constantly complain and see of his neighbors have been telling him that all like, for example, the crew. Is it Smokey outside the car door or that he dropped by the place? I went around and then like this is way too many damages that sort of thing. But because I don't usually go outside. So it's a lot of like and he will always present when I put it back. Basically, and the way through, right? So the price of the house, keep the house. We need to do something about this become about now, you know, K. Okay. So eventually it like having to pay me because it was slow running, right to pay the monthly and then when we had to calculate days, so the first I think it was the first Model S something like that. Come by in a couple of months."
"I don't think Kylie said the number of days that you slide. So the amount is less. He wants more. Okay, and then I said, because I was going to drop the check off all I mail the check or something and he said, actually, can we meet"
"So I said, okay. Where do you work? I'll drop by for a late lunch or like after what my kind of thing you don't do. I just drop by to see if I don't spend too much time because you are complaining right now in this house. And then he went on and on that day about the house, how come the holes and drills? And whatever can we meet at the house? Okay, at the house where you guys are feeling? Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And for me, too, I have the check ready, but you went to the recall play today's. Ok. So sure we can do that. So I didn't think much about it. Right? So that day I was supposed to have dinner with my friends, but they had all gone off fuss because I need to go and settle this guy. So I went down to the place alone. I was a bit late. So on the way there, I was over there."
"Sorry, could this guy is like going to be an angsty and everything, right? I'm still sorry. I'm a little bit late. So she was waiting for me."
"And white. Okay. He saw because you never met me for this the minute. He saw me. He I I went for a handshake, right, but he took my hand and kissed, it. Then don't change its. Okay, its okay. Its okay, should be 4 years ago with, for 5 years. We need to know that you are no idea who you are. I don't know. How, do you know anything? I was in a turtleneck long sleeve. OK, Google tell you that you can have whatever you where I can happen, Okay, so I said, okay, let's go."
So we wait.
"Nothing happened to lift. He was talking to me. And you was busy saying this and that and I was just actually, it was like conversation, right? And then we go out to the house. So he, I think he's always him cuz I don't have a set of keys and then we went in but I wasn't thinking so I didn't lock the door. I don't know. Okay, cannot remember now. Okay. Yeah, but I have this thing and it's just a funny story."
"Okay, and then maybe 5 minutes and Sookie turn the lights on, right? And I said, okay, what me if you wanted to talk about it? Everything relevant, just so fed up bringing me around the house, right? And then I felt a little bit like, you are making things up as well. Like I paid it everyday. When I mean,"
"5 minutes in. I do not remember right now. I think it's very, very fuzzy right now. But when we were in one of the rooms basically was showing me something and then he hugs me from the back and started trying to kiss me, kiss, you wear on your head, but this region dodging. And I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, but"
"I don't know how I feel like before it happens to you. You know, when you hear about these things, you feel like you scream, you run, you keep the file in the balls."
"But at that time, right? You really hard thing. And I was actually like frozen. I had my silver and I had my phone in my hand, but I couldn't unlock it and would mean everything, you know, it wasn't in my hands because I wasn't deadline make myself comfortable. So I was just literally holding everything I had with me. So I was trying to unlock this phone, is he? And I couldn't. So I was dodging this thing and I got out of his grip."
"And at that point, right? Don't ask me why? I'm thinking no cuz all this I couldn't think like I think but I said, let's carry on the house."
"This professionalism right now. I'm professional lady. I don't know where you at right now that maybe might have continued to like try and talk the counting, but anything else have enough of that? So"
"Week 8 are the house, are you in the house? And then it happened a second time coming from behind behind again. And this time, he tried to put his head on my shirt."
"A long-sleeve turtleneck. It makes me late. So angry, I have many, many hockey and what I wanted to hear."
"Say it say, oh my God, OK Google. How do you get a second timer for like a very scared and I pushed his head and I tried to swim all this great. And I said, no, no, no, and I remember after he moved his hand, out of my shirt, he GroupMe from outside."
"What is wrong with this guy? What is wrong with him? Okay. Okay. So what happened after that? Tell us, ok, Google. So I was Rip van with a nose, but ya don't have a screaming, still have a rotten. Tuna while I think in that moment, I can just go Frozen. Yeah, I was very scared. I remember, I said, tell me what you need to tell me I'm using, but because I didn't know whether like, I can leave myself, you know, I had to wait for this guy because like the door was closed wife was blocked. Okay, but I remember because this came out in court. So I remember that in the house after that happen. I managed to send a text to one of my colleagues who, who I was meeting for dinner, and I think I was just like,"
"Right on the vulgarity. And I said, no. No, no, just call me call me, or something like that. Or something along those lines, and he might have done it to other people. So you are the one like spilling nonsense, you know what I mean? Because he's so what exactly do you manage to leave the house here? So I said, tell me when you tell me, I need to leave. Okay. So this is the craziest bit, right? Because I still stand and talk to this guy, right? And I still tell me where you go after this. Let me send you. I said, no, no, no, please. No. So before I went out, I had booked the gravity and I said, this is how we just made out of this."
Too Late by by me.
"Let me take you out to dinner sometime. I said, yeah, buy eggs normal men. He might project the craziness on you brought this MF to court so after it happened, so I went to dinner with my friends and I spoke about this right now. What do I do now in descent reported? It sounds great, but I'm actually scared. I was, I was for a minute, I was, I don't know. Why was that was very hesitant. I was like, how do I go to the police? You know, like what do I do? So it took me actually one day. I didn't go that night. It was the next day."
"I kept replaying in my mind. Okay, and I kept trying to like maybe makes uses for it, maybe deny it but at some point I felt like no, I think I was very violated and I have to do something about this. So I didn't go to the police station and it was a little bit easier because we had every detail about him and see we had, we had his car and reciting address is not an issue. Finding this guy. I went over to the police station. I made a report off which they did ask me. Like, how can I do if your day to come there? I think there is a stomach issue to be honest because we don't expect police officers to be trained in sexual harassment today for the right thing to do, perhaps to bring in an expert on the topic."
"Do that, right? So I made the report and then so the company was aware of this and they were ready to drop the house and carry this right now. I think the police had gone to look for him not but I don't think it was like immediate arrest because there was like a process, right? So I didn't do you like maybe question him or whatever. It was that happened. Maybe a week later. I started getting messages from him."
"Say what basically apologizing asking me to drop. It telling me likes stories of like, oh my wife passed away. My daughter is this is you please please please and messages which eventually helped me through your considerations when you were thinking like shit, I take the sack or should I make it a key? So when when I replace it, right? They said, if we have to bring this a card, would you be okay with it? And I said yellow, but I think if he hadn't liked right to defend himself or if he"
"Admitted to it, it would have gone to call but because he wanted to swim out of it. Okay, so he wanted to fight like to be said he was saying that he didn't do it like texting all these things, right and a half later flight because of due process. And this is why I tell you I can still remember before going. I was so scared because that meant I was going to see him again and you haven't seen him since then. Yeah. Yeah, but what were, what were you feeling when you saw him again? I remember arriving at the club house that morning and I saw him outside the room and he was sitting there with his, his lawyer with somebody."
He saw me and he looked at me and shook his head and also sorry.
"Are you crazy or what? The fact that he can shake his hit at? You are like, you are the one. That's at fault here is just disgusting Indian. What was his sentence? Did he get punished? It went on for a couple of days. If I was only at court for the first day of the First with understand and then I think he was and then they brought in like the colleague. I texted that the iOS were involved in the case as well as to all that I wasn't there anymore. And then maybe a couple months later. I received the letter from the police that said that he had been sentenced to 13 months."
"Thank you to the Singapore, police force for bringing Justice. Yes, what is were amazing baby, And I just want to say to that, to listen, to start listening to this, and this has happened to you before. Let us a story of a catalyst for you to go and get your own Justice. You can shove it under the rug for as many years as you want, but it's still trauma that will never be solved and we'll never go away and it will affect other parts of your life. If you don't get the Justice, you deserve. Because I think that now that I think back on it, if I had swept it under the rug at night time."
"I think I would still think about end of the day, but because I had done that right disclosure. I don't think about it anymore, unless it's being brought up and I can like talk about it. Now, you know, I think that many different kinds of cases, where, for example, in some cases, the puppet Rita might not be so goddamn stupid. They might not even a crumb of evidence. And in that sense, the justice system. They have to follow due process. Might not be able to prosecute, but to be honest, I really believe in, and I believe that good people will prove you. Yes. So thank you. It was meeting us some examples, you know, from our own who has hit her on how what police Action Wrestling really can affect your life. No matter what age you are. The one thing that was that happened before the cameramen actually be very, very inappropriate remarks to a Channel, newsasia producer, and this camera"
"Actually WhatsApp to write and sit that. She copy apresenta. Because number one, she has no boobs. And number two, girls shouldn't be too smart for their own good jokes. And you also can you imagine if this this producer didn't didn't say a single would, nobody would have known and his cameraman May proceed to say similar disgusting, things to other people and it was really terrified them for the rest of your life. Exactly. And I think another example was, you know, in the workplace this woman actually received unsolicited sexual messages from a male colleague. Okay, and she reported it up so she had the courage that she talked about it, but the management brushed it offer. They said that noise you're making something out of nothing and just brushed her off."
"So you need to understand as well, if you're listening and you're working in the workplace that brush cutting off like that. There's nothing at all. And I don't think you say physically safe exactly in a setting like that. Exactly. And if you are an employee and you're listening, please make sure that this does not happen in your workplace, and that your colleagues, no matter, female or male Leaf, you support it because I think it's also too. Damn, long time and thinking to bring up the issue, correct? Yes, or, you know, you at least look into it. Yeah, only one in three victims actually report. What play? Sexual harassment in Singapore. So there's so many, many, many cases. That completely go unnoticed. You are a friend of mine, was sharing this story because she works in the law firm, right? And when I texted them about what play sexual harassment, she was the first one in the group chat to say that."
"Very common in the, the legal industry lawyers. I mean, anyways, she sent me this article about how old is former lawyer from a taut Law. Firm was brought to court for molesting a collie and taking intimate photos of her. And I was reading the article and this lawyer similar to that the person that, as well as mentioning he eventually texted 215, apologizing, and asking and it came to drop the case, you know, something people know the consequences of sexual harassing, but why do you still do it? I think at the point when it happens, right? For for the victim, I think shock is completely normal. Like, what is there, a his kind of shared with us as well. And even Hazel that you would dump him yourself when it happened, but didn't really happen."
"Naturally, you wouldn't want it to happen to you. And also at that point of time, right? I mean you don't react if you didn't leave yet, but that's what I think is at that point of time you feel a bit uncomfortable. Then you should know that something is off, no matter how much it was that accidentally on purpose. If you just feel a slight oz of, you know, you're not very comfortable. You use the speaker, trust your gut, you know, that it's wrong. Maybe not at that point, but even maybe a day or two days later when you have thought through it. Yeah, so I guess, like, in terms of the authorities, right? Maybe they could be a bit more understanding about why it takes time. He's even weeks for the victims to come back and report. It is that he buy this from the police point of view. They also have to understand the longer. You take gets fuzzy as well as soon as possible."
"Didn't exactly. Have some advice hear from her. We're okay on how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace. I'll give me at Singapore. OK, Google to consider talking to someone that you really trust. This person doesn't have to be in your place. Can be our moms can be a trusted friend, just literally have a second opinion, right? Because now it's all in your head. And if you're alone and you're thinking about it, right. Honestly, you might drive myself crazy in. This is like spiraling to know where correct. I also think once you realize it right, then you really like me that much do something about from an organization or a service? Even who have experience in helping people with you know, who have been sexually harassed and such as aware as workplace harassment and discrimination advisory. This is a free service. I can even just be for emotional support. Maybe you're not looking to take legal action if I'm going to happen 10 years ago."
"Okay, you kind of want to get over that, trauma. They can help me with such things. But if you need me to help, you can also help you in the face with someone that you do. You work with. I think it's good to review the company's internal workplace sexual harassment policies is one. If there is not one than that. I should be. If you do, you kind of have reason with yourself and you're going to approach it. Alright, to take this chance as, you know, a way to impact change in your workplace. That the next time that you're jr. Join right. And they won't go through the same thing. She did not do that. This guy could have still been renting locations to your company and those 18 19 year olds."
"If it's just happened, right? Very important. I mean, now we've literally got digital footprint everywhere. You can screenshot everything all, get everything out in Black and White 2 voice, memos, whatever that you can to protect yourself cuz you ain't Puttin. Her memory is getting fuzzy year of the incident. Right? So, you know, this happened, so we should definitely just write down but I guess not important. Reason why women, especially, we are afraid to report incident is because we're afraid of Revenge asshole, right after coming out from Jill. She comes and stuck. You and cost to put a hunter. Have you ever considered that have thought about it? But, I mean, like, people know where we work, you do."
"Not selfie, so he didn't know. So if you wants to hand me down easy, so that scares me a little bit. But as of now thankfully nothing has happened. But I also, I can't imagine how hard it must be for others to, you know, step forward and make a report on to tell people because even for myself, right every week until it sells, one of the loudest ones, the most haunted hotels in the mall unifocal. Once when I was going to do this, you do this, you waiting, if I love you right out in green, you run to the police, but when it happened to begin with, you know, you be very afraid of retaliation getting fired. You're getting a bet rep and not being able to be hired and stuff like that, but I don't think"
"I think a lot of that exist in our mind and when Justice is truly suffer, write the fact is that people wouldn't want to work with your papa Teresa. You you were not at fault no matter what you were doing when I fault because I don't teach your daughters not to wear this in that teach your sons to Kik and text themselves."
"It's true. It's true. It's true. You can normalize that, you know, we went to normalize it. There's no cheese. That's going to happen from there. So we've also discussed that, you know, women there are a lot of reasons that we might find, you know, to be a bit hesitant when it comes to reporting, right. So we encourage you, definitely. If you're listening right now, if you want to speak to, you know, someone on the clarity team will keep you all just always confidential as well as you go, see how we can help you and we can even just be a listening ear if it's something that happened long ago, but yes, feel free to DM us at its clarity.com. Okay, so about this episode, right? What would be your advice to people who have experienced sexual harassment? Hazel someone similar thing where it's kind of like a a physical touch kind of sexual harassment. I still cannot be sure whether it's on purpose or by accident."
"But I would tell that person, give him the benefit of the doubt, just this. Once it ever happens again, then, you know, for sure it is no accident and you have to report it. And this is what I would say. And also, if you have friends coming to you with the personal experiences of being sexually harassed, just try to give them a try to put yourself in their shoes. And no matter how how creating a solution is know, what the guy ran for it and then go to the police. Just understand that. In that moment, when things that just happen, it's a bit hot for the victim to be dead then on the spot and we would not ever notice winning until we are in 8 hours, which I hope none of us have the experience is not ever in a life. Someone is like, maybe an intern working young, just enter the workforce and someone of a more powerful position actually sexually. Harass them."
"I'd say don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Even if it's that point of time, right? You know, you may think that your your actions will questionable because that was all. I thought about a lot like I thought like I will be questioned and why I still stayed like it doesn't make sense. Why would I say what time is a cliche? But I hope you know that I think at this point enough people have come out to share the stories and I think we understand a little bit backed up. I think people are more empathetic as well that we understand and we know that at that point of time you can react the way you think you would have. And if you think that your actions will questionable or anything like that. Don't let that stop you from coming forward. Because whatever happened still happened and it feels that it is still wrong and you should still speak out about it. Definitely. I think your safety really really comes first and, you know, I would love to get to the root of the problem, which is that when we were young, right? I do."
"Remember anyone teaching me about sexual harassment? And I didn't know how to identify sexual harassment. You know, I've been molested in like MRT before when I was like, 12 years old. I didn't even know. I was being molested. Did you eventually know that Auntie saw it? And she said, she'll take me to take care of the train to get off at the next stop to get away from the perpetrator. Basically. I think you have younger siblings, teach them. This is very important. You need to teach them how to identify sexual harassment and sexual assault. What can you do in that moment to understand that this is an assault against me. Where is is that? They are like, it's a twelve-year-old. I would even know that guy, you know, that me and stuff. I would even though I would have just gone on what exactly it entails so that they are able to identify and to come back to you and tell you what exactly happened. I also read something especially for younger kids."
"I read the thing where they sit, as parents, like, don't use you don't like old names like code words for your private parts and things like that actual time because if they know the word place of all the assault of would be more free to do it because they know this person knows this vocabulary. Okay, and they can also come back and tell you more specifically I can you remind me that when I have a child next time. I'm afraid I'll forget."
I need the address given out the log that good at 5 asking the person. What do you mean when someone say something offensive?
"Sexual harassment. But please know that it's very important to come up and I think a lot of experience on par with sexual assault. But because most of us need to sweep under the rug, no matter how many people believe you, I don't believe you. We are here for you men and women International women's day."
"Thank you so much for listening to us. Once again, I'm Hazel amazura. I'm tomato. Will see you next time and calamities."
But it's all that by myself. When I went to pee the nurse had to stay outside with Ricky and if there is

All that trying to defend yourself from your thoughts.
but didn't change the fact that I
Life biological can think straight when I'm in that state line. Just overwhelmed that I can't stop crying.
"Sushiden recommended me to you Doctor referral to see a psychiatrist because he was getting quite as I was getting worse. So the call. Yeah, so I think that shows that was really really stressed and she asked me then if you have no phone and you're not sure."
"Appointment sheet, depression and medication and my family members. And I want to have any questioning thing done. So if I became very suicidal and to bring me to the e, n e a c e."
"All the time that you do that. I think, when they ask you, if you have any thoughts of killing yourself, you have a plan."
"And that's when they decide that, you know, me but option because then that's when you offer it to you. My symptoms have been there for a long time. I'll get psychologies and OTC me that you mention, if you don't want to see. Yeah, it wasn't it."
"So, but I knew that was option in up sending my medications every day, but I was still very anxious."
"Yeah, I think I lost sight. I was very, very, very drowsy HD. Sometimes taking anti-depressants can meet you feel more depressed. First before, I didn't know that until she told me."
"So that she depressed afterwards and that was when I read it. When I get out of it, I need it."
To get some breakfast. I tried to go back to work.
"The symptoms of severe and I think another major change at first, then he had to move out, is that his new job. And, you know, I was still so overly reliant on him. So that was a very big change for me that I couldn't handle. Yeah, I went to work."
The very first day of his first day of work and then I broke down. So even walking what's the hospital already crying?
And then I walked into the toilet and I stayed there for
"An hour, even after I texted Michael you and I stop somewhere with my supervisor. Came to find me and she got me on the toilet and she sent me down because I do feel better trying to make me feel better. So, as I was trying, she asked me if I was."
And it's been 19. She said that she didn't feel safe for me to go home myself. I had to call my sister to come down. Pick me up.
Go home the next day. I was very depressed. You want to get out my bed?
Because I mixed up my and seasonally.
my supervisor told my sister to bring me to rain in Mission again this year for
"Come down to see me, and she did."
Inside.
"I only said, yes because they said that they will allow my sister to sleep over."
"It when I when you know, it's very few phone cuz you know, I watch a lot of movies and then it wasn't like that."
But you could tell that.
"People give you when you, when you tell them doing what?"
Was it my sister did some Googling in The Hayloft good reviews?
"If you didn't allow me to walk in here, to push me in a wheelchair. I couldn't even go by myself, but I went to pee."
The Outsiders the door slightly. Ajar
Do you know what is falling apart from not having access to my phone?
"Having your family members today, as you do your phone or video call. So what you do location to God?"
"And, of course, the usual site, Lights Out by 9:30. So you can only use them what phones from 9 to 9, and then because"
I bet I was only available after 9.
"For me, I think the meeting was being patient."
"Pajamas was a very experienced professional. I've been working with patients by myself. I didn't bring the uniform, the pajamas everyday. Custody remind me for using my family's phone to go down for some fresh air."
You know that even if you don't have nearest because you're afraid that you have to keep all your belongings. So you have to keep quest for every time you want to shower.
"Delete all the stuff for you, right? And you don't see me and Haley likes Isabel bike. Is it was good thing that I myself."
Can be very safe respect for you. So having that space away from
Everyone going home address for you. So I guess who having the hell off?
"The multidisciplinary team within a, what is the psychologies always having easy access."
"Okay, do we need focus on getting better in the treatments?"
"Best a psychiatrist. The doctors trying to figure out what was the cause of my lunch, my negative thoughts, understand what happens in the end. That's why I want to be here. When you're in there. You are supposed to be seeking treatment. So,"
"I said that I didn't want any medications to make me so drowsy, that I can't even think straight."
And I didn't want to be tied down and I told them that right stuff and you can only do that when you stop being very aggressive stuff in other patients because they are by the way.
"But do you have a team of doctors who specialize in Psychiatry? And I think,"
"Yeah, I guess that I did it."
I'm stuck in that turn off the weekday cuz I guess you're starting to seem space doing the same things over and over.
And it's been I felt like you were safe because I couldn't see myself. So.
I could only become stronger.
Like when my friend asked me about how my experience was in there?
"You are so difficult, and I really wanted to keep myself up because I couldn't, I couldn't lie become more resilient."
"Will be there for you, I think knowing I already kind of realize. Who am I the one?"
"I'm organizing, who would be visiting visiting colors in the whole day. You don't have any 42 in my phone. I simply text to all my closest friends and I see him here, like she said, texting to them."
"Getting better. Yes. So only when I was at Jasmine, adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression. Usually, after a major change in your life, like this is very normal, excessive response to it. And you can come in the form of symptoms that are like anxiety, depression. So that's why I told the doctor that I really need his physical presence and Southern."
"He doesn't make me feel bad that when I speak to you on the phone, when I seen your call. I just need his physical presence."
"He talks to me. I don't see any, let's all start using addiction."
"It so happens. I'm the addiction specialist and a drink that you can go to when you feel stress. So, when I start feeling very anxious, so, you know that he sort of become smaller physical and the deed in a person. So when he leaves"
Single leg seeing him and my family giving me access to drugs. So that's not going to help me. I have a lot more in.
"It's too when I can see it when I can see, what can I do if I cut myself?"
"shall I attempt to kill myself, so,"
Because he was supposed to be at the building.
Play Space.
So it's not just for myself. I feel like there's a voice Robbie and the doctors also recognized that the fancy you stop calling us often. She needs to get better cuz I guess.
Like he's quite concerned. So he or she would try to call me.
You guys have.
It has somehow gotten into addiction of being what?
We need help. Because
"Cold, turkey treatment is actually very effective. So I guess,"
"Yeah, so I became very frustrated in my own situation cuz I didn't feel I was getting better. I called my boyfriend."
"I called my boyfriend one night and I see you like, I'm already here."
Like what else you want me to do some holidays.
After all.
I was following the plan will be so.
"When you left, I started writing the first few days was very difficult because I was very anxious. The one I was left alone house, crying and I cut myself to get me off. Your, this is a prison and treated like a prisoner."
"Yeah, so did I and I give you some medication to calm you down because this is a voluntary admission."
"It was very difficult, but then I started to see some progress in and I spoke to my counselor from the sitting all that. It's okay to still break down. Sometimes you have to be kind of yourself and see, actually see the progress that. So then I realized it's true that some progress, I said that having less sex."
Two steps forward. One step back.
Treat yourself of it.
"And he kind of yourself, you realize you only have yourself to rely on at the end of the day to become more resilient to be more self-sufficient. So I guess my family or my friends to stay over the night with me to become more independent. And yeah, so I would see them quite independent, you know, I chose to go to car."
Because I knew that.
"Lexa singaporeans are going there for the occupational, therapy caused from Singapore. And my sister also said, you know."
You just forgot how you will.
"You know, how, you know that, you can go back to what did I do? And I realize, I really like writing. I think. All right."
"So that was. Why is it doing that day when I broke down? And then they tried to call me dog medications and I'll see you like being, right? You might series did that was the only time I was comfortable being alone."
"Getting better after reading now on my thoughts. And that's what I did for the remaining. And what I do know is that I wrote and check a lot when I was feeling stressed and the Very night when I was left alone after my family, left at 9 after sniffing and frying whatnot in. Yeah, I got to the continent as well. Stick of people and I started writing and I just feel like he actually"
Writing is the only way I can feel comfortable being alone.
"Anybody help? So,"
Inviting weeks is Uline.
"Then I quit set clear boundaries for myself and for my boyfriend as well, cuz I think that's been a set of expected. I he likes ya."
"Yeah, you know what? That was when I realized that you you need to."
Know what you can and cannot control. So I really
things that you can control.
That y'all.
"You can be prepared for the week to come, so you can."
"You know, make sure that whatever you can prepare for it, you do. So let you know how my work. Then make sure that."
"Everything and I make sure that I try not to use my phone to my friend's for dinner, or go for movie things that you look forward to and ignore his things that you cannot control. So, I guess the songs of my anxiety worse because I felt so out of control all the time, the things that about. So I really wrote down things that I cannot control, which is like,"
"Atocha the environment the rules. Even the medication side effects,"
Things that you cannot control with Alexa.
"I guess other people's reactions and expectations about what you can control is your own expectations and your own behavior in the understanding, you can be supported."
"Thanks Street, and I also wrote down things."
"What book and tell me when I'm feeling very overwhelmed, so I wrote down and I actually gave it to my Verizon. And one day when I was feeling very stressed. I actually had to read this."
Read it back to me.
"Please turn off of me solutions that can you show me some empathy. Can you name an acknowledgement emotions? Can you say something? Like, you know, I know you got for you must be feeling very anxious and angry because of so and so and then you into the reason to show that you have been paying attention."
"So, I think that really makes a person feel hot and she let you know that experiences jelly Uno."
"He struggled to find was to see to me. So I would like, can you please not Solutions and I'm upset because more often than not, I really thought about it doesn't work for me or at least I'm not willing to accept any form of suggestions or solution to the point of time. I'm just very overwhelmed."
"So, like I said, can you please acknowledge my emotions?"
"Can you show me a puppy? You say things that I know you're very difficult for you. And I know that I can see that you're feeling very and just because of when you said the reason, because the reasons might change every time and to show that you're really listening to the person."
"You have to start off, she got out why they're feeling the way you lie to us. And also kind of why I was feeling guilty because you see that you're not in control."
"Angle are so that's why I thought that writing down, what I can and cannot control."
"And then at least two weeks. So I can be up to 13 months, but I didn't buy enough to last night. I have had enough video understand the plan and I felt that there wasn't a need for me to be in the war anymore."
Which is not. So after I cleaned all my plans.
And how I'm going to.
Prepare for the week to come. I show the doctor the list of all the things that I wrote myself.
"And then I see, I want to go."
Yeah.
"And he said, yes. Okay. Yeah, I think you showed me that you are ready to go home and how importance of having a recovery plan. So I think they call it like a reaction before. He can be discharged from the psychiatry."
"How's it going to manage if the experience that triggers and your symptoms again, and if they can prove that they have a safe and healthy oats and then you can go I wrote down the things that I was doing them out. That I said, you know, it's important to be prepared for the week to come. So,"
I already know what my shoes are and I already put my family and my boyfriend had to react to stress. So.
I thought that was regrettable.
Definitely not a one-way street light Stephanie going to be.
Even tell people that I don't think I'm a hundred percent recovered yet. Yesterday's by breakdown.
"If he not going to be easy for me, or for people around me, say I even though I tell people that, I don't think I'm a hundred percent uncontrollably, set your phone or angry just you."
"I guess you really need to pace yourself and have more realistic expectations of yourself. Like for me, it is and I don't allow room for mistakes."
"MVD of unnecessary stress on for myself, so,"
"I have gone back to work, but I'm only going back part time. So I guess we're using a self tattoo."
A healthy routine.
Helpful things that you like to do. What I did was you on leave. So even after two weeks and doing it two weeks. I kept myself busy. So I just joined gym membership.
So alone with my anxiety and depression to the Sea.
"Sticking to my boyfriend and I have forgot about everything and everyone else. So I guess that was a good time for me to shut off because then I'll be thinking, I'm going to be sliced in half and then about my plans for your getting a house of this savings are going to take. Even the thoughts off. You going for."
Money.
"But yeah, I realized it was important step that I need to take to become."
Better again then.
All this stuff a way of life.

"How to get money channel channel channel do well in school and was struggling all these families, have a happy home. So, like back then it was really, that just me trying to stay afloat. And I think it's a young young, Singapore Ain't Goin out. Like that is pretty tough enough for anyone. So I think it's a blessing that I met this girl that I know now. She was brought up in the very religious background and Shadow close-knit family, the family. So close-knit and you know, I love my family but man a family is just as you just feels like no I have another family that really touches my heart knowing that you know, I have I have another shoulder to lean on I guess."
"Yeah, and you know, it is actually more importantly, the relationship there, like finding the one right away, a little bit of both, but I also do think it's a little bit more growth. Okay, because loveislove. All right, but I think given circumstances, if things change, if something happens, you know, the adversity that you could have faced in life. I don't think just love is enough to carry the truth, especially in Singapore."
"As well. Because I do think that that's a lot of other things like in the mix, you know, that that is very important. It's a choice, right? So it's really the end of the day. It's two people choosing to be with each other every single day, but it doesn't mean that you said once and then that, that is true for the next eight or 10. Yes, but I think it's an everyday thing. Yeah. That in spite of this and that despite of this and that I still choose you so nice that you can take when it comes to team Destiny and also have romantic things that, you know, when will it take me through in life, but"
"I found it. I think for me is very important to put in hard work and effort into a relationship. But what's more important is you must find a suitable person to begin with? So if it's not exactly sure how much you put in that relationship is going to be very, very hot. No matter how handsome he is. If his personality sucks. It sucks. It's true because I think if it's just not meant to be I just can't work. Right? If you just do different. I think that's why people so I can go. Is it really supposed to be this hot? Yeah, that's true. I think. Personally, for me, I believe in soulmates, but it's not my soulmate is actually my best friend. Adam. And so she's my soul mate because we are like twin flames, you know, we get each other and I'm sorry. It's a butt."
"Then again, I do believe is of is the one. That's why I think it's different. So make me and the one he is someone that you know, can help me grow can heal me an invite. He did like, you know, I was in a really bad place for many years and he took the hard work, he stayed with me and he healed me. And today, I'm a much better person because of him. Look at it. But I like even though you don't really like certain things about yourself and like, the other person that you would expect. He likes that spot of you. So that's like something, very beautiful. What is wonderful by the relationship, they were actually together for. Of time and then they broke up but they found each other back in your life."
"Navigate. Yeah, because he broke up and look after many months. So, you know, I try to cut things off and let you know if you came back to each other. So that's quite a thing, you guys, patched back. So you guys were together before, I think, when you break up you can see what's out in the world. And you made a conscious decision to patch back with this person is stronger than ever. I don't know that, I don't know if it's publicity, but I guess a lot of us believe in destiny but not work as well. Since you are single right now. Do you think you will find the one? I honestly don't think this?"
"The so many people look at the thing, about the entire world. And what is the one for me? Tom Holland, because of circumstances, because of distance because of, I don't know, how can I ever forget?"
"If it happened to happen, you walking on the street one day."
"I gave you that. He's he's a bit skeptical about finding the one at this age. I think actually in the entire world and many the ones out there, you just have to put in effort to make that one. That's what I think. So, I think it must be a good balance of both. You must find him a suitable and then both of you have to put an equal amount of hard work and effort to make this relationship work, right? What do you think that people still believe in finding the one these days in general? You like with Linda and all that? I mean you sort such as you start the one that we exactly. Like for me, I would say my next relationship is going to be my last and I really really hope that happens which is why I'm so skeptical about stepping into it, because this is so many things to make sure you. I'm so scared. Like, what is this guy? Doesn't turn out to be who I want you to be aware and these are my future husband or the father of my future kids to be."
"Add a flashlight. You guys have fallen like the ones in your life as well as he was married. It's so, you think, do you think that people believe in the one these days? I think, honestly, people still do believe in the one and I think it is because it's a natural thing for us humans to do. And you always look out, the words, know something that it's magical and, you know, just something that we can explain, but, you know, it's meant to be. So I think in that sense, people still believe in the one, you can take it all babe. It's impossible, but I didn't do anything that affects that this stuff, you know, in the society know how how we how we see love, as you know, how, we how we interact with each other and go in because it sounds so magical my head, right? I want to believe that this exists, but whether it doesn't know, I don't know. And I like to keep it that way in my head, right? So many is"
It doesn't have to be romantic.
"Writes it does have to be a romantic partner and because 7 billion people in the world, right? It really feels like there must be that one person out there. Who's your twin flame? Soul food, you know you let your do you like split 22 and you could believe it living like a leading very, very different lives with the dually life completely different circumstances, but I always feel like, what if you meet this message, and if you ever meet this, wasn't his life by it. Feel like you're single present waiting for you, okay?"
Listen to the first podcast.
"But you did something that might be interesting to know, right? People who believe in true love. I actually more likely to ghost their Partners, you know, ghost out of a relationship, because when you believe in true love, right, sometimes you blind yourself to the negative parts of Europe and you just play me. Believe, this is my soulmate. I would love this person, no matter what. Then in the end to get set. The Nicole sister said they argue. It was thinking of maybe this person isn't the one for me. He is my soulmate because of all the negativity. I think I've always been in a relationship. So I wouldn't know because I feel like once you step into a relationship is NVIDIA commitment is offer, you know, you got to you got to work towards something. You know, how I know that."
"I am destined to be with him forever. Is that when I was dating, like other people, right? I would always think like, is this going to be the one, what is a Surface? The one that I meant to be with, for the rest of my life. So, when I'm with a surf, I don't have that. Thought, like, should I be with someone else? Is there? Someone else out there? So, that's how I told him. Yeah. I know. I'm stuck with you forever."
"And I think that believing that soul mates are perfectly compatible for each. Other can also give rise to a lot of unrealistic expectations. And that is very detrimental in a relationship. I think when you, when you believe such right, maybe you wouldn't put in as much effort as you think. Like, I have my soulmate, and I think she should just walk out by themselves, but I think we have come to, the conclusion relationships, are hot work. Even if I think that, you know, while like a v-sit, how do you find the one? There are billions of people in this world? It could be like a french guy having coffee right now in berries and trying to say that it's very unlikely that you'll find true soulmate just because of geographical boundaries, right? But perhaps the notion of the one has also evolved and changed and it might not happen at the start of the relationship as you grow your realize that it actually. This is the one"
"Else. It takes time to know whether or not. This person is the one for you and of course a lot of work. So what went through your mind when you know, you guys were going to that prick. Why don't you go back to her ex is going to sound cheesy, but like,"
"Didn't that breaker? I couldn't stop thinking about that person. And honestly, like, it was only that person, that could make me feel like, you know, better about myself and because, you know, I personally, I am the type of guy that really, like, I hate myself. Like I don't like how I look and I have a lot. I am deeply insecure. I honestly felt like I need someone who can help me in cuz I can't be self helping myself. Every time I can't, I don't have the emotional capacity to let you know. And I was just yearning to talk to her again, you know, it's really hard to explain, but it's just that you need feeling of wanting to be accepted by someone. And yeah. What time we got back together again to talk and it's time. We we actually talk to each other we and miss miss miss, try to really has all the problems that we had. And, you know, that all the disagreement that we had an understanding each other at the moment. I need to think about it. When you first got together, you guys were 18. It's very young don't. You might have been maybe a bit more mature?"
"We understand too much about life and I think that I'm just so happy that you guys managed to find each other again. So I think falling in love, you know, dating and having that whole situation, while it has changed so much right person only told me it was actually the same. So now people fall in love on the internet. I fell in love with a Civ on MSN Messenger. When he never talked to you. They love you today. I I pretend I didn't know him, but in at night on MSN Messenger, right? We would video call for the whole night let you know. When I seem like who are you buy on the internet?"
"It's a long fall, so every Friday and then after that, we had something over the house. So, okay, probably today, surprise today. So she said just like him actually, she just like his girlfriend. He says that he has met me before the time. I remembered. Okay, I do remember anything. You said that I've been through"
"House before. And he has seen me before. Because apparently, when I was at his house the first time, the one I don't remember, he wasn't at home and his mother called him. And is he going home now?"
I don't remember any.
"Cuz I like I could do, you know, it's situation is not just like in 291. All right, but the First Communication tools inside yella easier to fall in love because I want to talk about dating in the Singaporean contact is very, very unromantic for because the way of proposal is a proposal that I have to bring her to like a"
"I haven't been on Facebook. Like I'm using a new phone and I was thinking, let you know, if you like Japan or something, you know, like the Universal Studios and then let you know, I would want to rent like a rental that particular like a Solitary Man. Something written originally just for her with audience and I'll just make a written to me like she has to say. Yes, so that's my boyfriend. I want to show someone I love and I want to show you that you like."
"To see what age do intend to propose to her realistically. Like, I want to propose to her, like before. 1:30. Like we at and get a house in Marion, I guess that's why I like having a relationship in Singapore. So, unromantic because everything is so expensive. And do you have this, do you have a house? Do you have a car to travel? Do you have insurance or Ashley? If you think about how back then, how I parent is to meet at falls in love and stay together and keep up the awesome. Give people the children to just like love and you are still very back to the basics. A very interesting talking about our parents and how loved, or so different in your time. Right? My parents met at a bowling alley. Yeah, it was like mutual friends and he went to Bull and that was the first meeting."
"Fall in love in different ways and it was definitely not what we have. Now. That's a my parents. They were introduced by my aunt. So my aunt was a Matchmaker. And honestly, I think matchmaking really doesn't work. You really have to meet the person at fine. If you have that common interest and stuff like that. So back in their times right? Making them do you make a simple? But you know how my parents if show me even though I personally don't think that they may be the one for each other but they definitely put a lot of hard work and effort into this relationship and also want to ask the three kids and they just try to make things work and I'm very appreciative of that. It's not just love but it's really like through thick and thin we have to stay together. I wouldn't say that people can go through that and not go to divorce. You know, how many"
"But they have been together for like 30 years now, but at the same time I feel like because there's been so much important has been put on, you know, Korea growth, like maybe just material things. Exactly do, nice, things. Just the bare minimum, but actually, I feel like sometimes people forget about why they're together in the first place. So much, focus on. Oh, I need to get this this this first and then or I can focus on this, but I think at the end of the day, if you look a little bit deeper into it, I feel like, why can't you just"
"Focus on the thing that actually is going to help me grow. If you focus a little bit more in a relationship, you might both grew and Excel better, definitely true, but I do have a partner that kind of shares the same kind of"
"Maybe like the ones you guys like about each other and number for me like I she she likes music and I like music. So as an artist right now, whatever song that I pulled out and one of the things that I do in in my career, she's always dead rooting for me. And you know, it's the small things like that. It kind of makes the relationship a bit more. Deep-rooted me. You don't like me and you shan't have any common things together. It's okay. Just make sure that possible."
"One question for all of us. And what is one word of advice you have for those? What you looking for? Love? Do you think love can be look for a Barbie looking for love Heavenly, but like do you think sometimes when you're not looking and that it comes?"
"Well, I mean it's possible but the chances are absolutely slim looking for love for that actively go out at least normal people, so that you can feel the, who's on your frequency and who is not a thing that gives you a better shot."
"You never know what my advice. Keep an open mind. Right? Don't lose off, 21. Just cause of looks just cause of, you know, something that you don't like about that. Cut through thing about that. Looks like a lot of the Instagram. And did you see whatever that's pretty and they like it in all these guys, aren't they? Thought I might as well as people out there. I think it's to take your time and not jumping to any relationships. Really even know this person before you commit to it because the last thing you want is for you to put in your heart, All Your Love, Your Soul into this relationship, only to find out that he or she is leaving. Is going to crumble. You are so, you know, no rush. I always advised to take it."
"Before you come, it's, that should be your advice to yourself. So yeah, it is. It is that idea to you don't meet people and talk to people and actually connected to be on a relationship. But just on a human level to people because I think if everybody has his idea that they want to be with the first lesson to fall in love with all, you know, if that is like a romantic idea in your head, but I think you will learn something from every person that you mean. And I think you may not even know what you actually really want from a relationship. Or you may not know what you look like in a relationship when you're in one. So I think it's okay to take that time and just like cool with it, you know, and I think that will grow you into the person that you would be happy with an intern that will attract the person that you you should be with us."
"My Tracks to try a credit union there for me, like, I totally agree. You just have to be friends with the person first. Have to get to notice the person that you are, you currently trying to talk to, and you really understand each other on a deeper level rather than just ignore surface-level at small talk. As I hate violence. Jackie said that. When you're speaking to someone else, don't look at him or her as your lifelong partner, but you mentioned and who knows better. Things become a while it is. You don't have this love conquers. All at the deal where you going blind me."
"But it's nice to have a romantic side. It is neither one. We're not telling, you know, don't be romantic. Be super practical know you can still meet, you know, a dreamer like thinking that you will find your one. It's just that you need to protect yourself. If you don't love yourself before, you can love somebody else. Okay, what you rather have loved and lost than never loved at all the perfect love, everything has been looking for, but maybe circumstances doesn't allow you to be together. So, would you rather have met that person? I just don't know what this love is in the first place at all. Nothing lost. Definitely. Yeah, I agree. I don't want to experience."
I think different people have different kind of know when you guys were living a lot for me.
"I was in love and loss. You know, that you mean? Things like bebber, we end of enough. One lasting can. Can we have y'all seen one line of his son. Let me just pull up the lyrics. Honestly, I forgot the lyrics. Yes. Sorry, I guess. No, no, no, no."
Hold on to the better.
So happy to have you here. And thank you very much for being outfit ever male guest.
"Listen to his new song, hopelessly devoted to you. Very, very good. Very good."
"But you need to this episode of cavities, and thank you so much is Clarity. Call for more updates on our next episode. If you want to check out y'all's beautiful face. We are on YouTube as well. That's right. Listen to us on me. Listen Spotify, Apple podcast, wherever you can see me a podcast for the Weis. Gas number one. Yeah, so you will be notified the minutes to put up a new episode and"
I meant if anybody can see a video.
"How is your experience being with us on Hotspot, and every day, when I sent it to be able to express, I erroneously became the people that hate."
"Hey, what's up? Its Tony. She was here with you and welcome to another episode of man explained to our repeat viewers. Thank you so much for being with us and for following us on this journey. I want to see a big Welcome to our new viewers and listeners as well. Men, explain is basically a podcast where we dissect the male perspective, and I always like to say this as doing my sister's a favor, cuz sometimes you really don't know what they're thinking, what goes on in their heads? For today's topic. We have a very special guest who will give us a very different, but important and essential perspective. I would say. And today's topic is gender discrimination and cultural sexism. Please welcome, Chris and a human rights Advocate Chris and I actually go way back 10 years ago. I think we were in school, right? Ten years more than 10 years has been a crazy ride."
"And we were having this conversation prior to the cameras started, rolling about how you identified yourself as a man for quite some time with you guys and see, if I guess you were very young, but in the beginning stages of school, when I knew you in poly, especially you still will refer to as he her. And then I said that you had her transition face. So maybe can you tell us a little bit more about that process? If we go way back in the story? I knew that I was a boy. When I was 5 years old, even though I had been assigned by the office this week, but I don't even use the word transgender when I was sixteen because of Wikipedia is Wikipedia, when somebody asked me to look up the phrase lgbtq."
"We do all that was just before you went. So I think what was interesting about that is that I want to say one of the reasons I want to play maybe it was that anyway, uniform, that gender equality. I think only two at the end of my dressing hairstyles twisties, and then I noticed starting to come out some people, so between that you keep on putting a new thought. Maybe if you would have five or six months, and during that time, I was, when I started, you need at my voice was talking to drop. If you've always wondered if I was sick, I was in the house, that's on a home with therapy. And so when I went in to Union after you remember this goes that I had gone to play with will my classmates now, so they still knew me as female, but the guys that had come in"
"They will I go to school early. And so that was interesting for a while because that was pure of time where nobody knew, but it to refer to me as he or she. But because I was able to come out to, I would like to wren's school of rock is very, very funny because of them being that you were going to call you Christopher. We're going to refer to you if he him pronounce very naturally. The whole cohort started to refer to me, as a very important part of why I was able to gain confidence. And so I come up even more publicly. It sounds like you had quite a smooth is right in terms of, for, you know, the experience with your classmates, you know, the lecturers and stuff like that. Would you say that was the case, watch me or what are moments, where it wasn't comfortable of people didn't know how to address the situation. I would think it's less about people's acceptance."
"I was going to be like in u.k., All these horror stories of people who suffered very much because they coming out and it's true. Even now it's School said because there are people who had differing opinions, all have certain powers that allow them to solve say, oh, you can't wear that to school. Lucky to have chosen this industry. Also, I think for me to explore and people just like cool rather than what you doing, an equally smooth ride and experience to maybe even if you're watching this right now, if I have to having a tough time, too, so maybe you can share this a thing or two. Like what can we do? Even if it's even though we weren't that close?"
"Elementary School, what can we do to religious show that we want to learn more? We want to educate ourselves more? What can we do to be better? So the interesting thing is that I think back then was not as readily available as it is now and I think a lot of the education of showing that I did in my position back then is very designed to"
"Make sure that you guys had a better understanding based on what I knew versus nowadays, where you can basically go on the internet and what's the right way to refer to them and immediately. So I get this."
A whole bunch of resources that people have been working on too many years. I bring this up because I think nowadays that stuff like this conversation about.
"Are the allies during fasting and I think that is something to be said on both sides, where one is am I allowing the space? Twilight's make mistakes and Gwendolyn and then on the other side is as an ally. Am I doing enough of my own work so that the labor doesn't fall and transported to tell me every single question that into me, a text to, Christina your head. I think that having that curiosity is very important."
"Issue that you as an ally can affect right? Just by virtue of being present. It says wiping. Has an event asking people to light up and support, right? Because even having that visibility you saying, I am an ally makes a lot of difference to somebody who is thinking about coming out even if you're not ready to do so yet and then the second aspect was the education which is"
"Money, where my mouth is apprehensive. And I think I was a little anxious too because I feel like I may not be doing enough to like learn a little bit more especially because we also in school and when you know, what in the same Social Circle, so I really hope that I don't know. I didn't offend you at any point or let you know come across as insensitive or I didn't learn. I didn't put enough effort a little bit more of, it was accessible. And if I wanted people to understand also maybe people"
"Like a battlefield beautiful women from behind in the office. Well, you know, cuz I'll get on before we started rolling to, we had this lengthy conversation about sexual orientation and gender. So, sexual orientation. Is that dependent on the agenda that you identify with? Yes. Yes. Okay. So I think it's easy way to understand it and some people completely. So I guess it doesn't help that you have. So most people are cisgender, which means that they are sexy signed by the doctor and birth alliance with how they identify. So if you are in your case, perhaps,"
"Safety-net, but I identify as a man, right? So I am trying to do that. And if you are female and attracted to other people who identify as male, then you would only 8. I want to exclusively attracted to people who identify as male or female, then you would be straight or bisexual. It's all contingent on the starting point, which is the fact that you identify the difference between"
"Is it going to change in identity about you, for example, and your orientation? And how do you address that? The one thing that was even though? I didn't know what transgender was. I started being attracted to people identify as female at a very young age and lesbian. You see the agenda? Then you see the agenda presentation."
"Mind if I identify a lot of people assume that all trans men must be straight because there is this misconception that can spin transition to make them fight because you transition to match your physical physical, physical body, closer to the image of that, you have of yourself and that relieves a lot of mental stress on social media. Do you say things that you said would be addressed? Because the reason why she was very frustrated as a trans woman is that a lot of people kept saying, like, oh, you do this and you tricked men into"
"Liking you or you do they use the word trick and all these kind of words that are very hurtful. I would say. And yeah, I don't know if it's too personal to ask but has anyone ever assume that of you before and said, very hurtful things in your face. The only thing I can think of is every time people ask me if I mean, it's National classification of diseases, which will be implemented in 2022 in Singapore, used to classify being transgender agenda at the time is called gender dysphoria."
"health issues, because it's more of a guy in the sex, then it just the 9th, which is, I think for the"
"For The Advocates, around the boat, 12, D medical eyes. It's so good. I mean, it is a good step right into consideration as well. So we're going to move to where it's cultural sex. Isn't something that we also went to a dress today. According to Rousseau University. It is a gendered power that is circulating embedded within a society that favors masculinity. So being very open about this. You've been on both sides said, okay to say the truth is when to dilute at me they will always receive the agenda daddy wants to proceed. So I think for I would say before I started to physical transmission maybe even a little bit after there's a lot of that condition."
"That you would undergo by society as somebody who is a sign, right, which was that the only woman must behave, a certain way must defer to. Your husband has been make the decision because this is favoring masculinity or give them more rights and privileges by virtue of their sex at that twas conditioning by the than actual suffering. What's interesting is that were crossing over to the other side when I started to be able to express."
"Ironically became the people that hate that before in the future. My wife have to listen to me because I'm the man. I'm sorry, if any of y'all watching this. I apologize. I was very young without trying to reconcile my gender identity with my religion. So yeah, but that was also like a nun reflection thing. And what was interesting is that I realize why I did that and if you don't behave that certain way, you are last man and for somebody who is transferred already struggling with it, with trying to convince society that you are mad at you."
"Do these things to an even greater extent to prove that you really are meant to overcompensate? Okay, I guess it's time for me to do a bit of sharing as well because you know, if you've been showing a lot too and since we're on the topic off light console, sex them as well. One of the things that stuck with me quite for quite a long time, came from a fellow colleague. He's no longer in the company and the industry and all that and and he was like, oh, yeah, I got you make it very far when he died."
"What? What do you mean by that you do? And he was like, it was just easier for you. Not to cuss pretty good. I feel like in general it discredits to put in. For example, I might have put it in the same amount of work that fellow colleague put in or perhaps, you know, I put more effort. I don't know whichever way he sees it but that kind of stopped me for very long time because I think at the end of the day, you don't want to just because it like you're successful because you're girl or because it's easier for you to get jobs cuz you can dress a certain way. All I can do. Is there anything I should do something interesting. Why do we blame the women while playing the game? That's it by executive met you."
"What you are, honestly, I haven't established for the organization yet. Somehow. You blame the people who are stuck in the system questions, right now that we are supposed to react to address, teach your son, not to rape, agree, or disagree. I agree as well cuz I'm quite sick of seeing, you know, a lot of comments in the comment section going like,"
"An example, you know what I mean? If somebody is going to be violence, unlike father is unnatural and better catechist, fathers should not get child custody in a divorce or separation based on your agenda. I think the whole idea that that are things that I've typed, your gender, that make it more natural for you to do something is fundamentally bullshit. Does that statement? As women are unsuitable to be eaters? If they are too emotional, is that right?"
Listen to do not respond with emotion against like a man. Like a man is not to be as angry as he wants to get like the gas light.
"Sleep, or mental health, or mental illnesses are emasculated."
"Okay, so many so many parts of the first is, I don't think having a mental health issue is a Bad Thing necessarily. It's not something that should be seen as makes you less again. So whether it's w doesn't and I don't do that is so that's a mental health pot. Many men. Do you think this because we had this whole culture of like I need to be perfect. I need to take out the way so that I can you do in a conversation that I had with a therapist. I used to see if he was saying sometimes, it's very hard like a switching couples counseling to get the husband or the boyfriend to come along because Stacy"
"He going for counseling or therapy as something very weak or something. They do need. Hopefully this is changing because I feel like one more people are seeing counseling and therapy as something that is, how did you realize? You know, it just is a way to check in with yourself to improve their relationships as well. Would you agree with that? That men are just distance in the emotions because they feel that they are only allowed to feel two things for his happiness and his anger."
"But there's no, there's no sadness. You're not allowed to be sad. You're not a lot of new ones and I think that is that is causing depression compounds because you think you're angry and you just angry at self when dating a female or else he would be seen as having no guts or not in control."
"At least shows like very explicit. Interest is like I think you're very cute or whatever that you know is going to wait. I'm just going to wait. How will we know if you are very difficult to me to the topic of proposals, right? Like girls kind of just always expect the men through the man or the boyfriend to propose for the Bible. So because I work with the lgbtq community"
"If you look at it that way, it's like it's never again. It's all advertising marketing. What we see in the media, to be honest. Okay. The next statement is women have to choose between motherhood and a career."
"I disagree with that. We know. So many successful moms. Are you do out there as well while juggling both and they're doing it perfectly. So respect to you all, is the fact that men should shame. The Lord of caregiving. It should not be the woman is the mom, so she can take care of all the baby. So the only thing I do is come home from work and then she cooks and cleans, and then she thinks about the washer potato potato. Why should we expect more from Alpine us? Whether you know, whatever, by the artist Cher in the Lord? Why should I be the only one member?"
"To expectations and, you know, our society as well. Because like what we see with our parents and grandparents are Grand at the other ones that go out and then you see, you know, that the lady of the house, taking care of all the, you know, what the home stuff and all that, you see it as it is. And then, as we go out, we also kind of realize that maybe subconsciously refill at that role, but I mixed it with his woman. I meant to look good and men are meant to be successful in their careers that I think. Now, it is especially in this day and it just so many successful in great positions. In the company is making change. Most importantly, are there in the world to have this conversation. We talked about, Jen. We talked about gender identity. You talked about sexual orientation, and I think it's important to remember that. These are just some aspects of somebody's life and they interviewed with each other."
"and that affects,"
"How you up to? See if I society and the Privileges that Society, of course? You. So, for example, my privileges, because I'm busy that mail are very different from when I was busy this female. I think this applies across the entire Spectrum, including race religion, gender gender, identity, sexual orientation class and a bunch of other things. And it's important to recognize that these intersectionalities where we can pay more attention to our own privileges. In other people's, you know, places where they may be discriminated, against light forward Hills, my main takeaway from this is that I realize also how ignorant a lot of us can be, and perhaps we're not putting enough effort as well to educate ourselves. So, I think my main takeaways, we need to be kinder to each other, to have been more understanding as well. It really doesn't take much effort to do a little bit of reading every day, or just have conversations with your friends with your family."
"Perhaps he even without parents, you know, sometimes they don't know as well as you don't realize that they're saying something offensive or hurtful thing. Kits videos up to us when we educate ourselves and we share it with other people. I think that's generally where it starts, Let me say, always, stop somewhere it. So hopefully it starts with u,"

How do you say the desert and welcome back to another episode of calamities?
"We're so happy to be back with you. And today we're talking about something that is not just a female Centric problem. It affects everyone and we have a special guest in the house. Thinking about what? Life balance. Tell us a bit more about yourself. Okay. So high and I am a full-time as a stewardess. And I also work freelance at the Smart local holding two jobs at once. If you might know her from her, Instagram handle, not Agnes B. What is the reason behind in summary? Right? When I was in secondary school, it started off as a joke kind of thing and I just stuck on a couple of times actually. Okay. It's like my name and everything but somehow, it doesn't stick, like, I don't know. It all eventually. I just got myself and then that's what happened."
"Is like a stage name for young people? Always assume a nice to meet you at first name Agnes. Last name. Be okay. In one day, we only have 24 hours. You can not pile so many things up in your life that you don't even have space to breathe. I know some people can't do that at some point. We really have to see. Okay, what are our priorities bullets? Keep it brief. Yes or no. That's what life balance. Really exist. Everything. Okay 321. Yes. Yeah, I think, you know, it really is what you make out of it, but it is a conscious effort to have that balance, right? So maybe we'll we'll go to each of us hazy when it comes to work life balance, be honest with us."
"What is your own experience that It Snow by Lindsay Allen choose not to have it. I enjoy working. I don't working a lot. I don't mind spending all my time from the moment when I wake up to the moment. Before I sleep to spend just on what we plan to email is planning my content. It's fun. If I'm being in a lot of what we may do DJ is your content creators. I always enjoy spending my show thinking of what to put on Instagram next. My Ig stories. You do Crossing everything is it just brings huge. Doors me very very hot looking. Thank you. It's like so packed that cable. I do enjoy it. Once. I wake up, I have things to do on my PS is a productive day. And then, once I go to sleep, I feel so comfortable."
"Inspection and to me as a person that's what makes me happy. But if you ask me, do I feel like I'm constantly working. No because the line of work that I do. You do if you really enjoy it before my flights. I do get ready. I think that's most hiring part of my job like before flight and after flights, because it's the waking up in the wee hours in the morning. Next lights, nowadays because of covid after fight, 12 hours UT on an aircraft and sometimes get delayed in countries and then come back. And then you're just like, I just want to sleep, but you can't take a good shower, remove everything and pack your bag and everything. That's the tiling part of my job. For the fly is honestly, like really, okay. So you don't feel like I just been to work."
"I know, pre-flight anyting. I think, when I used to be in like Polly and everything, I have been awake for nearly Forty-Eight Hours. Yeah, cuz I run on coffee and sugar so I can function without sleep, but I'm someone who can't function without sleep, but I need to get work done. And eventually, it's very unhealthy because their dicks at all on your body. By they ultimately, you can have the satisfaction of finishing up, whatever work that you have. And in the middle of these, you also do other things, you know, like my form of break is like, you don't like beyond the break. We were friends as like, my down time right there. What about you? I love what I do. Think that"
"We are all very lucky that we get to do something that we love everyday and does not feel like, well, you know, we don't have to drag all so well, but at the same time, it's very important for me, right? Okay. So first of all, we all know that I run a little bit more energy than most people. Every day. I do. I don't get physically diet, but I do get mad. So I need to take that time for myself and I have consciously made an effort right to understand that what will never end. And when I need it, I'll put myself first. So it may not be the best thing because I think sometimes"
"Sometimes, I need to call her husband to reach him. Tell him, I feel like you need to be unapologetically yourself and take time for yourself. I think sometimes honestly, it's just necessary to do that. So I'm that person right, who can okay, if I have a lot of work and I've been doing with it inside and everything of it at some point. I will put my phone as I think, I'm going to eat, love it. I love it. That's irresponsible. But I'm sorry, I need that 20 minutes a half an hour to eat. Don't stop me. I'll give it to you later because I can't auction now to see my, my version of a break. The one thing. I cannot give up a sleep. I cannot forego sleep, you know, if I don't sleep, at least, at least six hours, right? Going to be grumpy that I can watch."
"It shows, you know, doing fun things, but sleep, I really cannot. That is when my mind rest, and that is literally when your brain heals. If you don't get REM sleep everyday. Hey, did you not hear from the stress of the day? I agree about my mental health. I am up that most of the time I find myself eating because I feel so tired, you know, and then I put on weight, then it becomes a vicious cycle. You know what I mean? So now I'm getting mostly 67 hours on at the amended Law, Firm, Jaime Lara zuroff when something just happened and it's a huge, right? Like it when I get into like a minor accident. I just think I was around by itself."
Is that as a fuck you to the will? I ate my dumping noodles?
"And a police at these with them, they would do anything about it. I called you. So you don't realize me just like a night of partying like yeah, and then"
"And they just sitting there like the one day, the one thing I have like those guys really long red eye flight and it started like 3 hours in the day and I just don't get enough sleep. So by the time I pack and do everything I usually get like 2 hours of sleep before a really, really long time popping on the red-eye."
"Let's move on. Okay, so let me tell you guys about these Concepts. Okay, let's get it done. What life balance? This is. Where you segregate? Okay. This is what this is life, right, you know, when I'm off work, I'm living my life, but these days lines of blood as we actually with work from home and with Sundays case, where you're not doing like a nine-to-five. Are you already off work here on standby waiting for the next gig and all that work. Life integration is something that love people practice where they don't see like, okay. This is what in this is life, but rather everything in life, it's all part of life. And it's all kind of like integrated together. There are some protein, that's on constant, is the pro. Is that okay? It gives you a bit more of a gentle transition, right? It's not such a hot sauce, Roux. Like I cannot do my work right now. Let me live my life right on the Khan is dead. With what from home with technology. You are always on 24/7. And if you don't give yourself that boundary you are bound to always"
Walking who has replied. What message at night.
"Obviously, right, yeah, I feel so bad for my colleagues in the summer. They do long sites and then I come back to be late. So when I come back, when I get like all the reception and then I got my pretty to texting me. This at like 2 p.m. To 8 p.m. Right now. I feel bad. I always feel so bad because I replied people so late, but that's the only time I have. Because I don't even ever thought about me and it's just, I'm not even contacted. And I think that's why I like, what you mentioned. It gets free blood, you know, you don't you don't realize that you're integrating, like small parts of your work and your life together is a very different situation for you as well."
"Coaster schedule, how do you use your eye kelore? So, I was never someone who writes things on my calendar. I can remember every single thing, me a side crib, but as I get older things in the brain, that shoots because I have my all lights off week this week. I kid, you not. I booked to shoot at the same time, the same dates with two different people, but I noticed it like 23 days before and I wouldn't change one of them because one of it was like an external tired, and I want of it. It's like, internal sounds. Like I am so, so sorry and I feel so bad. I didn't like keep track of my stuff. So, yeah, I know they say you the calendar and then I would like to remind us like a few hours to be so upset because I'm telling you this."
"Looking too much into that. It feels sometimes you always. So she would love it. But you know, it's supposed to calendar filling up your light is when I don't put things in immediately. You forget about them. Sometimes you're like, okay, you say okay, you say okay, say, okay, and then you let it happen, but things are coming in and, you know that, but that was like, suck your own. Oh my God. What was it? What was it? You don't even know where to look, sometimes, like, I forget something."
"You know what? I mean? So basically, they can choose whether or not they want to come into the office and they can choose the hours. Do you guys think this off, hybrid walking situation is better or worse. For what like that lens better work from home is going to benefit her a lot. And she's very, very efficient and competent south of Joyce, of your sentence and credible. And when you need to come in, you can choose to come in here. Have some time away from her, do the family, and all that. And I think it working out with you don't realize it how important night people and some of us are like morning morning. People can wake up like whoa, like when I used to work like 9 to 5, I was dreading dragging myself to work because it was so"
"Early in the morning as well, but then things started changing the crust off set a schedule I had and I could come in a lot later like 11 a.m. But that's fine. But that's fine because I have a couple of hours of break in the middle. Yeah, but that was just a few hours of going to sleep in inside a bit later cuz I'm not a morning person and it increases your productivity as well because of these things have shifted the way that you're going to work with me at 9 to 5 situation, and it's great. I think it's better for the wall. But if all mental health and people are getting used to it as a spot of it, nobody knew what was going on knowing you. How do you know, separate the last. I don't never get around things. I do know that we used to it and employees alike and knowledge. That, you know, this is possible that this might even be too helpful for the employees. So people are creating systems around it, and that's and that's great. Thanks."
"Covid-19 realize how many meetings can be virtual email? Well that's organized the meeting if you walk into the meeting room, 5 minutes late. OK? Google, show me women, right? We might feel a pressure when it comes to achieving work-life balance. We need to think about when we have a family, if you are working full-time and you think are your family. How are you actually going to balance? Both of that stuff? But I know one thing's for sure. I want to be there for my kids at the my own family. I definitely want to maybe do part is my work so much heart as my family because, you know, if you miss it, that time will be gone forever."
"It will only be this young was, that's how I know that I'm not ready for a child because I'm not willing to give up anything in my life right now. Okay. Dedicate and it's I think it's not being selfish. But rather you want to love your child and had that space with him. That's being selfless, actually, because if you jump into it without being for pet and you don't have the time for your kids that's being selfish. That's true as well. It's really something that most people don't understand. I feel or even come to a point where they are ready to prioritize and things like how you mentioned that you are not ready to, to have kids. And that's okay. That is what scares me is because you want to do and you want to keep up with your car and lifestyle. But you also want to be able to fully be there for your kids and a part of me wonders. If that is just a wishful thinking you don't actually write quite recently. I had a conversation with a male colleague."
"And this person. So basically was asking me about whether I had plenty of kids, and I said, yeah, but, you know, I think it's scary because I don't know if I'll be able to handle both without having to give things up yet. And he said, honestly, I think you might have to. And honestly, I think it's harder for goes. So he feels like he can still carry on doing whatever he does because he's a guy and he saw and gets away with it a little bit more and he said, you know, I don't know, that sounds terrible, but sometimes"
"The mothers. I just need a little bit more and I understand where he's coming from you, but as a father, like, you got to put in the equal amount of net, right? And you have to pick up the slack, it's not just on the mom. So as a father, going in through a situation, having a kid, you need to be prepared to give up something as well to be there for your family. Maybe more, if it comes from making the bread in the back. After I do, agree to be a bit more emotionally dependent and maybe also because the father has made it, such a awesome. I think it's just the way that we've been brought up both my grandfather and my dad are very much involved in anything or go to my mom and my dad, actually. Yeah, it would be like"
"And what do I do video? Black cool thing. Like, what you mentioned? The dancing like step up. And I think both my mom and my dad made a lot of sacrifices to raise me and my sister but I think when it comes to work life, balance, something that really cause me anxiety, is this whole idea of the hustle culture because I go into social media. I see people post on Tik-Tok. Here's my day 5 a.m. Coffee running. 7 a.m. Have a bowl of salad by 7 a.m. Remember any, that's still one day that they did that to talk about hustle culture. I think like my personal opinion and also according to El is workaholism with like a very nice."
"Tiny named Witt. Are you overworking yourself and making itself burned out? Like I have a cousin who works in Investment Banking. She used to work until 3 a.m. Wake up at 5 and go back to work, zero fee, as much as I love my work. I love my job. I cannot forego my Street by Jimmy is mentioned. I don't think I've ever been awake for twenty-four hours straight. Like I cannot, I, at least had to take a nap or rest. So I don't know how they have enough plates and things are. But I do things. I'd, you know, guys, struggle with what life balance a lot as well because of how they seek careers and their lives. How do you know hold as such high-value? Am I think that is a reason for them to self struggle with what life balance as well? Okay, and I think a lot of guys, I understanding that every"
"At home is 50/50, right? Because women are walking. It's I think you're understanding that it said together thing, which is great. So that stinks on your plate as well. I feel, and I think that it's a struggle for the balance is. Well. Yeah, so and he's the kind who will not eat and sit at his desk and that's dangerous, like that food is lying. Right, who will come in and say, listen today, you die tomorrow to replace, you want to send this to my dad, but it's true. And every time I feel like people spread themselves too thin, I think in reading the remember today you die tomorrow to replace. You reset true at the end of the day. No amount of wealth is more important than your health."
"Is it healthy for me to say this, but I can't enjoy it."
"That's great. But I also do end up myself. In workout sessions run. I don't keep my muse at all. I sleep. Well, that's cool that we compensate for working with our own like self-love, kind of things I do, but I just always feel too content, right? That's why I feel stressed. I am still awake and I see it. That's what I know. Okay."
"Okay, there's something actually eat that. I need to ask you guys. It might be a very tough question of. I have to put you on the spot. It's called the work Paradox. Triangle. So, there are three points of a triangle. Right? One of them is sleep. One of them is work. The last one is social life. You can only choose two out of three so far example, if you to sleep and what you have, no social life. Okay? Okay. That's the idea. Which one you would you fall asleep on your social life? Okay. Let's go on my social life. Social activity for me to me. That's how yeah, I think I'll give up social life as well, because"
"What can I eat to meet you? And I'll see you on flight? Okay, you look forward to your roster because you know, they're going to meet you and when I'm at like PSL, I'm a confused with my friends. I don't feel I'm going there and drinking my boss or anything. It's more like creating content together. So I'm cool. Break as well. So, yeah, and I'm not with an environment that you work with is so important. Part of the problem. I struggle with answer for Me. OK, Google sleep."
"I'm about to beat you but it's true. It's a problem. I struggle with it doesn't help that. I don't need as much sleep. I have more energy, you know, I mean, so I don't feel physically tired by mentally tired. And I know, I meant he tired and because I don't want to give up as a thing. I rather forgo my sleep so I can get everything else, but this woman can really function on. No, sleep is 3, insane as she can function of no coffee as well. I can't wait for you to be telling you more, but that's what I can function without coffee, and without sleep. That's crazy. She want. Till what time was it? Can you just do a quick recap that day, with your overnight? Shoot, those terrible. I went from Radio at 5 to 9 p.m., Right, and that are on sale at 9:30 p.m. And then I shot till 2 p.m. The next day."
"Play overnight during the night till the morning to ask you, yesterday, afternoon, and I had to be a meeting at 3 p.m. So I didn't get to go home. I went straight for recording, right? Or recorded. And then the show Psych turn on Bill 9 p.m. Again that she wasn't even grumpy. Like she was still in High Spirits very happy but like angry at the world."
"That's nice. I mean honestly if I was in the shoes, I would do the same thing cuz I like tired. Physically it is. Then again. I don't want. Let's go another shoot. Let's go. Don't you think you cannot give your best for the shoot? No, I don't do that at like 4 a.m. In the morning and I will call time for like a shoot at like 9, so if I let it for me, I get back home at 5:30 or 6. So by the time I see the sunrise at 7, I sleep for like an hour and then that's it. I got up at 8, but I don't feel tired that we can always put on."
"Realize it's well a few nights. That's something I will give up. My social life. The thing is that, I, I like being alone. So I find it. I recover the most, when I'm alone, if I'm doing nothing or whatever. So, I can forgo meeting my friends. Not them. At some point in a life where we just called to hurt, and then something gives me, is that the right now for you guys for anyone. So, last week, I had like back-to-back flights. So in like, 7 days to do false,"
"I wake up at 5 everyday and then I will fly all the way to come back, maybe past midnight, sometimes or maybe at 11 or 2:10 p.m. And then I'll just let you rest for like the next day and you should eat it. The next day arrest. You Don't Feel fully rested. Yeah, because you have to wake up and I don't have jet lag because I've learned how to cope with it for a very long time. So either come back. Do you need even if it's like at 12 or whatever? I don't see through this, like, 2 and 3 a.m. I'm sitting on my phone watching, Tik-Tok and going like this thing about screwing at night. So this is something that I encounter as well. Every night. I need to sit by myself and I'm just on my phone or just, you know, taking some time to myself, even though I'm really not. Even though I know I should sleep, even though it's like really late and I read somewhere that it's called something like skeet Rebellion, or vent, or something like that."
"They get her body because you have control of your time at 9:01, get you and you feel like I'm going to rebell against sleep. I'm going to do what I think is discipline to just put your phone so I can just go to bed because once you start scrolling, you cannot stop. That's true. But what about the both of you better with it? But maybe about a year or year-and-a-half ago, I felt so. So tired, from everything that was going on. I came home every day and it cried. Okay? Every day. I was just crying. I was upset. I didn't want to. You don't do anything anymore, but I will feel like I fuck it. I do want to do anything anymore that. Don't show up the shit. You know, I can forgo that part of my life. I didn't know how to look at it in a positive way Jose. No, sometimes they know where can I find it really hard to turn things down? And I think he's already changed my perspective on that like even though he might have had a really tough and long day when he comes home. He can leave it at work. He doesn't bring it."
"Home through the front door, it was right for me to do. But now I try to do that as well, you know, my problems exist outside of my personal space. Let me decompress by myself. And I think that's something they told us to practice when we saw the Flying Squirrel. Let you every time if I slept a whole day. I'll just touch it and say that it's my feeling even 1,000 ft above ground. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares. Nothing. So I'll be on that vessel and when I'm leaving the aircraft of like, okay, that's it. Whatever Happened on the bus next bus to life and if you kind of get into the momentum after a while, you helps you breathe a lot more with you, but what about you?"
"If you the most so many times in my phone, a half years of being in this industry, especially cuz I'm on the night felt so bad quickly. Sometimes I feel in the morning so and at 12 midnight, so now they go to sleep. And I choose me to be back at 7. So I have to wake up at 6 a.m. Right, which means I'm getting back to you. I was asleep even though he's no 10. It's 3 hours. I think you very very but until, you know, even though I'm there on set, I feel like my mind is even though I know that I'm not getting enough rest and I just asked myself. I'm so cute. Why do I have to work? Why?"
"You are upset me and I feel a lot more negative. I feel like I need to being eat every chance I get, and just snooze in ticket. If you even more tired, I don't like that at all. So what I can do is just try to schedule my shoots a bit more for the pot. So it doesn't affect my videos right now and I hate it. When everything gets into the way of my radio. Show me my listen to the store first before. Anyone else. I think it's really is a conscious decision that you have to make for yourself. Exactly zero. What about you? I have began to notice that I saw go through a bed out every quarter and I'll feel a bit off and once I know it's the right. I have to say that little break, even if just one day, I feel like it's very important cuz if not everything and the quality of"
"My presence is compromised and that stresses me out with him. I cannot give you my best. That's what I know. Give me some time. Let me know. Just sort of like a little bit higher level of fun and just sort of like, we can liberate before I come back and continue running. Absolutely and burn out. Right is something that can cause health problems as well, and you don't realize it. But in the long run, it not only hurts. Like your productivity. It has been proven to cause a weakened immune systems as well as cardiovascular disease. So these two have very real consequences and it doesn't help that Singapore has ranked. The second most overlooked City optic naps to go away if someone's napping on a cubicle and she said that like very hot. LOL."
"Maybe we can share some tips with, you know, the people listening right now for my own personal experience. How can we cope and deal with bun out? Because I think a lot of people are facing that as well. For sure. I didn't used to believe in this, but after speaking with a boyfriend, I found that solo staycations really helped me recalibrate, a lot where I'm staying the night View, and then come back and buy my favorite tacos. This is a very good way. I second that notion. By the way, it's almost the best, but this is Ben Affleck's little bit."
"Because I realized, I didn't realize the importance of a solo staycation until I went to see again, right? And obviously, no hotel rooms and then I open the window and I saw the sunset in to Melbourne and outside."
"Yes, and then I noticed but I absolutely love seeing sunset and sunrise so I'm not have been as I quit. Timing sex and sit and look at you. You beautiful thing, you know, the kind of thing. So don't like small things that I do to make myself feel good and I like the cool with but I think your friends are a very important group of people. I didn't realize how important friends are because I'm very comfortable in my own space. So very solo person that you leave me alone. I am very, very happy, you know, but my friends always have to remind me hungry. Just checking. It's just that one sentence and I don't don't, don't over work, remind a good support. System is very important. You always listen to me every night before we do. So and I just want to say, I appreciate you too. So much."
"But yeah, I think that with the company that you keep, right? Some people take away, more energy from you. Then they saw a flight give to you, the surround yourself with people that imagine you're a wilted flower surround yourself with people that will water you and kind of revitalize you all the time. You're going to keep giving and giving and giving because you are a nice person you like. Oh you poor thing going to keep bothering you but nobody's going to be there at 2 to hold it back. Unless you find the right, people. You got to take care of yourself, not right? And nobody's going to do that. And that will like we mentioned earlier that was compromised and productivity and it won't do any good lass. I feel like sometimes you really going to be selfish for me.

I'm going to focus on my family. So that is"
"Some people don't have a choice. I feel like the upload. I feel at this point in their lives. It does not exist and it's almost impossible. And I think these are, I actually know someone like that. You know what? She is a mother of two young kids working from home is tough because the kids are around all the time and she doesn't have family when she can rely on to, you know, send them away. So you do people say it takes a village to raise a kid and I believe it's true, but when you don't have a support system, and when you are the only thing that they have"
"Then how did you ever find the time for yourself? Yeah, that's true. You miss very foolish or a good support system is very important, you know, if you have the luxury of doing so of having friends, having a good family, good colleagues and all that Sheryl Sandberg, and she mention that her husband having a good supportive, husband is very important and it's not say that it doesn't have to be there for you, 100% of the time but it's just a little things like, oh maybe he drops you off at work. He picks you up from your gig from the airport or something like that. He's supportive of whatever that you want to do. Yeah, I think mentally. That's very cool. Thank you. Who is a support system? Is your family? Well, that's a big question."
"I would see my friends, your friends. Yeah, because as much as my family is my support system. My sister is like my first priority as I come back home. I D stress. She's Eleven by the way, so she's a kid have to put that in cuz a lot of people don't get it. Like, why she's like my distress tool really long flight. And she's like, how is always hugging me to be a very, very close is always, like sleeping on top of nation sleep without me. So I realized I can be attached and I can see that her too. So she specifically is one of my support system. My fundamental support is my friends because we all from the airline industry. So everyone knows that I was schedule is like super irritating. Nobody is lying thing about the same time and if we are we try to meet up or we like FaceTime each other just to remind, I was like, hey we are here for you. So we could be having issues sometimes with work and life because you always do somehow for each other. You don't feel so alone. You don't feel so bogged down by every"

I mean, in friend, I didn't realize that that was was actually, I didn't expect because all my friends were very understanding all my life forever to reply messages. Like I said, I look at the message. I'll read it and I'll be like, I don't have the capacity to reply. I want to meet later. You're like, oh my God, like hello night.

"Welcome back to something, private a podcast on Southeast, Asian women, by Southeast Asian, women, exploring conversations, around Health, the South community and left. My name is Nicole, and I am your producer and host."
"The study of the season with an episode on it season, which is essentially prolonging a person's for the Soviet Union in an artillery cars."
"Run these over. Here's twenty-five. And I've never been more convinced to fit my ex especially since I know I won't be setting down anytime soon. Now will I have kids before and 35? But the conversation around. Fertility cannot wait until 10 because of the whole concept of a biological. Also. The number of its behalf is limited. So for persons who are assigned, the female reproductive system at first as anywhere, between half a million, to 1000000 eggs from the time that diab on Andy's, number drastically declines, from the estimated that by the time a woman is study. She has lost about 90% of x and by the time she's forty she's left. So if you are in your mid-twenties, someone like me, I probably lost about I would say 80% of my ex by now. I don't need to consider. Is that not only"
"Do we need to think about the quantity of X but also the quality of a eggs. So as the number of its designs, so that the quality of it, I can spend a whole episode going into fertility reproduction, while doing research on this stupid. Was that in Singapore, only persons, with medical grounds are allowed to fish at 62, social it freezing as they call it."
"Let me introduce you to my guests for today. My name is, I am 42 years old. I've been living in Singapore for the past. Now for 10 years. I'm out. So I found her and enable are of company called Freedom match. Well, I started this business because I always like real women and I'm still a moment that I realized. I need to share sleeps in my family. I realize that I could not do a crazy because if it's too late according to my doctor, so I set up the this company to help other Single Ladies, like my situation who love to focus on their career, but also wants to have a family on their own in the future. If they want to plan everything. I've helped him to go through that Journey outside."
"Tell me a little bit about the story of how you came to know about it. Freezing. I always liked what I did. I started my career is a Headhunter in Korea and my boss that time brought me to Singapore and answer that I had a very interesting career changes to our private Banker. I found the bankers career fascinating and because it brings our values, the most of the people he was always carry a career for me and I love that whatever I did. I was like, oh, we always wanted to have a loving family man, two to three children in my whole life. So it's not like one day. I wake up all I want children, but Family Planning was something I could not. I just thought of something I could not do it on my own. So I just postpone it, even taking it. Seriously, not to mention in a planning on my own. If you want to have an affair."
"We've killed with a child. What do you need? You need a sperm and can you produce sperm on your own? You need a man. Only a man could fulfill my dream so that it was a sort of a vague idea of future. What has to happen to fulfill my dream. So until that happened, the fertility help. Never came to my reality. What point did you realize that if I'm not going to be able to find a man, then I really need to stop taking matters into my own hands. I started being, I am aging, maybe I should have checked, all my offer to the chi health. I mean, even the first of the word for didn't help me at all. It just all my Health Centre health. I should check on them. So, when I went to Korea for vacation, my sister pop, this question, why don't you just"
"Read your ex. I'm like freezing my ass. So I just went to see a doctor and my fertility hormones. Test level was not that high but was still good enough for Doctor to tell me what show me, what on your face. You're asked you already 37. So I was like, okay, let me think about it. So I know it came back to Singapore. I needed some some search. I would not say that was a soloist art, but we believe me the information. I just found out it's not cost-effective or it doesn't really make sense to me because there's not so much data around and looks like they're possessed rate is so low for a procedure to procedure. That is expensive and invasive and a time-consuming and not to mention that."
Not available in Singapore because I'm single. So I could not make a decision. You just procrastinated then expensive procedure and you have to travel out. I dated diligently instead.
I used the dating apps and meeting people quite a few but finding a right man. Hasn't happened and fizzing egg option.
"Didn't make sense either. So I was a little restless, but"
It was when I made a decision to do a freezing.
"It was too late and it didn't make sense for me to go to the egg freezing, my fertility level, which is a, which is taking us to buy a few blood tests to be specific some hormone past the level of this hormone indicates that it doesn't make sense for me to go through that X reason. Cuz you mind me might end up getting no eggs or one the best. So I cried of course at the doctor's office. I couldn't believe I was crying at the time cuz you feel vulnerable. So yeah. And the end I couldn't face my eyes."
"I was upsetting time, but"
"Funny thing is I thought you was end of the word meaning. I could not make my dream come true. Having a children having a child Haven, but the facility hormone past just indicate. When you go through overstimulating, your ovary. You just getting less eggs, then no more people. It doesn't mean that you, it's impossible to conceive a baby naturally, but back then I thought it was the devastating. You said, I cannot have a family, the doctor said that it doesn't make sense for you to do the ex using on your own, right? But he mentioned that that that doesn't mean you will not be able to have children in the future. Let's do that. Slim possibility of a natural conception explain any woman before menopause."
"Can have a baby, right. It just, if you do everything, you go through this over-stimulating ovary, which will produce more people act. And because of this ovarian reserve hormone test when you go through this over-stimulating ovary."
You will have a last act like or no ass at all it depending on the level of the hormone test.
"That doesn't mean that you cannot produce an egg every month. So naturally in natural conception, our ovary produce one egg at a time, like at least ovulate one mature egg every month, but when you go through overstimulating process in a freezing, you will produce multiple a disease, the whole notion."
"But because of my fertility hormones tells it's a lower level. I most likely have very, very low egg. So it doesn't make sense to spend that much money to produce one possible. At that means, you can go multiple rounds of egg freezing. Meaning spending multiple times cost to collect one egg, say to"
"At a time. So you can have a multiple rounds of egg freezing to collect many acts as possible or you can choose natural conception, which will also give you a very low chance or that's not impossible. But the possibilities are there. It just little difficult. If you ate at the doctor's office, I just simply thought it's almost impossible. It could be impossible but you never know. It just doesn't make sense. Just that bomb that it's not possible for you to do x-rays eating. I thought it's impossible to have a baby about your journey from leaving a doctor's office and deciding that you no longer want to see soarx and how you've used the knowledge on"
"Fidelity to empower other women. The first time I took a blood test for 2017 and I did not take any action for 2 years. I just stated the religion play. That's what I did and then in 2019. I went back to doctors office, read the determination this time. I'll do it. Then I heard it. Negatively news. So I need to research and take the older data out there and check on the procedure, taking the risk and cost and data behind. And then I realized I got to share this to people out there cuz there's not so many, so much unbiased information. And correct information is available on the internet and not to mention finding any."
"Went through everything in Singapore was almost impossible. Because as you know, people don't talk about if he fulfills chain, became a stigma. If you are not married, a certain age and not having a baby at certain age in Asia all together, right? So first I thought I share this option and knowledge about a fertility health. So I set up a company. Now, let's go into a procedure. So then you will understand better away before thinking about exercising. I would like to recommend that you go to see a doctor to check on your fertility else has to be preceded before even considering it freezing. I must emphasize you schedule doctor's appointment and go on and take a blood test and plus"
Ultrasound test for these tests. Doctor will know if your body conditions are suitable for everything.
"If you hear some alarming words from your doctor, then you will take it, seriously. And then, even going to doctor."
"You know, I'll give you some idea or conception about fertility help. So I strongly recommend this no matter how old are you. Are you do this? And then once you a doctor says, okay, your body condition seems to be good. You can we can proceed then this is important also because not many hospitals or doctors will even mention. This is a body conditioning. Once you're doing some research on one side. I want you to condition your body, you know, it's the same time because it's all about quality of an ex. So let me know how many ask you will collect. If those acts are not good enough. It will be useless in Indiana. So why you are doing research on your body, through a healthy lifestyle, having a healthy lifestyle and good diet, and good exercise."
"And then third step is now, you are going to get home from the hospital and then do a self hormone injections for 10 days. So, this is my new, make a decision. I should I do, if I feel like I said, but these hormones will stimulate your ovary and grow old OS, India, follicles in your ovaries. So once it's the last shot, you will give me injection. Will induce ovulation artificially and then the last step of procedure is surgery. So you're going under mild sedation and it will take about 15 minutes."
"And once eggs are collected, and it will be kept in a specially-designed tank and it will be frozen."
"Now, I have to list and besides, on the last, the final step of the whole Expedition journey is IVF. So, when you think about egg freezing, you think all the procedure in a hospital and freezing it? That's it. No, you have to think through what will happen with these acts in the end. When you decide to use your frozen eggs. Later, part later years, you have to go back to the hospital and go through this process called IVF. Meaning for July vitalization outside of your body with healthy sperm with your frozen eggs. And this IVF procedure is also very expensive, but not many people think about this IVF process in the end when you do X-rays,"
This is a technical part. So.
"Big 5 Steps 1, blood test ultrasound test, that should be done, way ahead. And then second when you are thinking about it, when you're doing research on the internet to"
"Body conditioning. And then once you make a, that was dead in the second step. And then third, when you make a decision, finally, let's go back. Then the doctor will give you a message and you will do self injection for 10 days or 90 depending on your body condition in the last part of X reading procedure in surgery, and which is actually easier. Cuz that's what we'll do. You just lay down with being blind in the final of the whole exiting journey is IVF and which will cost you another arms and legs."
I was going to say initially. I think it's freezing sound like a very ideal option to me. But I've had a lot of stories where people talk about.
"Yeah. You ain't he love her stories of even the Thursday about injecting the hormones into your body. Like, it seems very scary and also essentially the cost of the whole procedure cuz you're not just paying for the Expedia. Also paying for the IVF, right, there are mixed together, but it's really unpredictable. Some people experienced nothing like having a curious. Some women feel headache, stomach, ache, or pain woman, don't have me, I don't have any. Pain. So depending on the person,"
It cannot generalize but it is. There is risk about 10%
"Experience this hyper stimulation problem, and it could, it could get serious and ended up hospital hospital for a for a week. And there could be another and other implications, and everybody, there are risk for your body for maybe future baby, but they will unlimited data available. It's a similar risk of another, the other surgeries that you could go, if you could do at a hospital, but the risk you really need to consult with your doctor who knows your condition. Once you ask for help for your eye freezing consideration, we will help you. We will go through everything risk caused process."
"Everything I do want to find interesting is that Beyond providing data and research and I guess emotional Comfort to these women that you are helping. I find the whole idea of essentially it is medical tourism, right? Like getting people from Singapore and I'm not sure if you you have clients from around southeast Asia, getting them over to South Korea to undergo. This procedure advances in technology, in South. Korea, is a better country for the procedure rather than like the US for instance. Where is that can be legal or even countries like Thailand or maybe, but what are the comparisons that we should be looking out for deciding factors, right? It could have been priced. It could be location. It could have be"
"It couldn't be a regulatory to standard that governs, our hospitals. So I waited all these pictures and take us in. Take Taiwan, take Malaysia Thailand. So many countries out. There actually offers. This service has all these deciding factors. I thought, soul is the place. I feel comfortable to recommend to anyone. One thing important is doctors experience. How can you improve that? How can you know, doctor has good experience or men experience in Korea? There is a third largest, the fertility center. And the technology here is actually a, the best. And when you do some technical research, I could confidently say that, you know, Korea standard is quite high at doctors."
And hospital. And then safety is also very important.
"Freezing egg is one thing but keeping those ass in a safe, environment is the most important part I thing. Cuz if you lose them your money and time, it's going to be wasted, right? So they've got to be some regulatory standards, set high. So the safety issue was also for me us. They actually have a very advanced technology and not to mention the whole big a market big market for the speciality science. But you flying there, it takes longer time and the price there is really high. It's almost a two times that someone three times. So that's when I realize I speak Korean in, I"
"I would not choose any other countries myself, but Rihanna, so I thought I could have shared these factors for taking a short break, something private to podcast produce and Anita publisher.

Dot-com slash something private part.
"Now, back to the next one."
"So before the covid Iran, this about 6 months. I promote the business and let them know there is a service available for the site. Also had a event public events. The oldest participants were very similar in the sky. Similar circumstances woman in mid 30s with a good career. Just like"
"Myself and a few people actually requested. What can I do? What, what should I do from here to go? To do? Everything passes are. So we were helping them, a body conditioning, and preparing traveling, but covid-19 happen. So as a matter of fact, there are few people waiting until whole crunch in lift a freedom as its mission is to empower women by providing this knowledge about fertility health and I asked for anything and then actually provide a practical, a practical option, right, you know, help him to travel and then guided into a hospital and go."
"What's the procedure together? And that was our set up in the meantime? Because I am in Korea. I'm doing the same thing. I'm sharing my knowledge with a career woman, in in Korean soul. And recently, I went on to this female only career development that phone stand by me to speak for their members. So, I'm doing all this campaign and to bring awareness to single ladies installer. I'm wondering if you can share a bit more about that of the women, not only in Singapore, but also in South Korea. What is the perception around like having children facility. So that whole egg freezing started with a cancer patient? Cuz if you go through chemotherapy some chemotherapy, will it mess it up?"
"Afterwards. So they started this process and then afterwards, they started for healthy woman because they found is a possible. So in that stupid premises why it's possible. What is the function of a ovary. Faster than that of the uterus? Your Uber started aging at 30 years old, but uterus, starts at 40 years old so you can save younger eggs."
"You know, when your ovary functions best and then use them later time is your your ass still is in better condition. So as premises is both quality and quantity of eggs, go down as you age. So the longer you, wait the worst, they can get these premises and make it possible this scenario. You can preserve your younger and donate to your older self later time. Then why some people also, you know, what? Actor is Don favor. This technology for me. I thought it so artificial to artificial. I want to go through natural conception. That was my first thought and they're not so much stayed around. And I feel like, oh, am I going to be a guinea pig?"
For this early a technology so that the whole lack of data is because the thing is too short. Some of the scientific data that's available to is actually referred a day before data from IVF Purex freezing. So that's not was so good enough. And also egg and egg is such a fragile cell.
"And the process of this freezing and thawing them don't show highest success rate with all this cost and you feel like it's not doesn't make sense. So there are some negative perception about egg freezing. I'm wondering if it's also because I've been doing research for this episode on the end of Singapore. When I was looking at the statistics, right there was close to nothing or infect. That was a statement put out by the government said that there's no data at all because social excusing, which is you. Let you mentioned that big freezing for individuals who don't have a medical condition is not allowed, right? So,"
"I'm wondering if he's also because of lack of social stigma for like Southeast Asian or Asian country in general where we don't want to encourage a woman to have her own family outside of a normal family unit of like a man and woman in electronic conceiving. And as well as to think about having children who have a family at a young age, you know, to have it in the next hour away. I'm wondering if this is neither some of the reasons as to why that people strong upon the procedure in general. Yeah. I understand where all those thoughts come from, but I can confidently say"
"It's not going to be rushing to a hospital. One for all ladies will wait around right outside of hospital. Was Singapore, government lift a restriction on Single Ladies snow."
They have to understand the whole society has been changed drastically woman now are educated woman all or have a good job.
"They don't feel necessary to find a man early, like a long time ago. They now or money, enough, money to buy bread. So no trend of having a baby or less baby, or no, baby at a later. Age is not going to be, it's not going to be reversed. I feel that it's a"
"Antiquated thought for women to have a family early age like in twenties and have a child children. Early thirties. It's it's going to get delayed and delayed its is inevitable. It's a whole social structure has been changed. I think they need that. This trend is not reversible and having giving them an option, doesn't encourage them to freeze their eggs cuz it is invasive and nobody wants to go through this ordeal with a lot of money spent. So my point is that providing unbiased information about fertility, infertility, procedure, and let them to choose. Let's give them options."
"Old woman now, it's okay. Like I said can make a conscious decision if they are a Fed with good amount. Good quality information in Asia, is is he still stigma?"
"Didn't meet the social expectacion on women. If they even considered a freezing older generation might give this Luke. Why don't you just get married and you know, it have a family but that's not that's not right perception. I think on woman who wants to control their life, when's to plan their career. From that perspective? I think in Singapore government needs to really consider this thing, dismissed fiction and let them, let them choose what ones are smaller than ever. When I realized that I couldn't feed my eggs. I was like a bit. I was angry. I was just like, I am not giving"
"The decision to other right to make my own decisions and I know I haven't said this. That the term Reproductive Rights across the wall. Looks like different because other parts of the world are struggling with like abortion, ban in abortion laws in here in Singapore to not have to go to that. We do have a good government in general, right. But I think we're moving past dead as we advance as a society and as a nation and globally, the next step is to empower women to make her own choices. When it comes to reproduction Singapore. I love how Singapore government to conduct their a government and very practical for medical as well. On the woman. I think they they need to be a little more flexible on women's issues to be honest."
"Using this procedure for cancer patient, that's almost 40 years ago and it when you get it, will only get better as time goes by, by the technology and science behind. It even open up your test and conduct surgery long, long time ago. It's not imaginable thing. But now people just do it if you have a cancer or any health issues and one day the x-rays and IVF will become popular. So people think everything is really new technology. Know the very first time that was used was for cancer patient, which is 40 years ago. And then now in Ivy if I'm sure you know, what IVF is in vitro fertilization that, you will hear some couples go through IVF multiple times."
"Part of IV. Officially, the first part of IVF is same as egg freezing over, stimulation of your ovary."
"It just freezing egg part is not included in IVF. So, in a nutshell X, raising procedure is the same is IVF. It's not really knew it just the data that exam risk is not complete, because it's only reason that healthy woman goes through a crazy. You know what I mean, is for infertile, couple 4X, reason is for healthy woman, so you can write really Apple. An apple comparison in that sends data is not a lot but you can still refer some of the data from IVF when you because I mean the success rates or risk or other matters, whatever you can tell me about being a woman."
Caring about her fertility. Do you have any last typing words or any advice to give to the women who are turning into a show? I would like you to think about your future meaning.
"I look into your fertility future. So maybe you can design when when you will have a last baby. Not the first baby or second baby, the last baby."
"At what age do you think backwards then? You will come to a point. Do I need to start taking care of my speciality? So I want to make. I want you to consider your fertility health and your future and at the same time, if you feel like freezing is a possible option for your case. Then come to Freedom match will will help you out throughout the journey. And"
I didn't think about fertility Health early enough. So I hope you don't make the same mistakes I made.
That's it.

"Never have I ever with someone. I know personally, I want company for many years that he's actually my brother. So I guess I'll see you tomorrow when I get back to work tonight, right? Was like, but I know when I am outside."
"I'll be the sentence. People often mistake my profession as a surrogate. They think that I have sex with my clients. They think that I use my body to help clients to be able to have sex. All better sides and a lot of clients will assume that oh, you are just you're just walking around my books. In reality. I actually teach them a sexual skills without having sex with. Then I'll give them like assignments and homework and then I can go home and practice by themselves or with a partner."
That's what anticipation of my who is going to come.
"What's up, it's so nice. You thank you so much for joining us on yet another episode of Men explain. And we just want to say heartfelt. Thanks for all the support and the views of the common so far. We're loving it. Keep them coming. If today's episode. We're going to address the all-important. Question, can men and women be friends of the day that was meant to be a surprise for me. But I guess it and I called, it days ago, took his Gomez infj, sweetest here, single single before, anything. I was supposed to be a surprise guest, but when she was told the topic did the main question of the day is, can men and women be friends. I think that is a very relevant topic to Astro. Give me cuz we not only have"
"Burritos are together or not. We actually do go out together and eat and go to haidilao and whatever it is that we do. So, that's the main question tag on the YouTube video. It's all personal opinions is not like the guidebook of the advice, because Sanya and I are, it could be very different to your friendship that you have the members of the opposite sex. Yeah, of course. Anyway, comes to platonic friendships. I mean, I've had my fair share of trying to platonic friendships, you know, along the past few years and did the, what is trying? As you can see, I think you're one of my own me, like, close male friends. And this is how I met Sonia again. For, like, the umpteenth time, the store for this, we get to go into detail and share things. That was not necessarily shared before 11 years ago as a 2010. Do I meet at ahead?"
"Teen party at butter Factory of all places. It's only true. I was about to go home, Tipsy AF and she tapped me on the shoulder and she says and just hoarse squeaky voice."
"Acura couldn't see. Anyone know you stay for a while, and I thought it was okay. Know, if a cute girl, like I asked you to stay just a. Yes, you did. I express interested day after the soda thing is. So we had a mutual friend. Call Rachel. Hello Richard. So cheer up. I was buying a Subway sandwich, while dming. Her, just now asking her for her number on Facebook, and then I thought, let's try to ask her out sometime, because there was like an attraction there and we met before my national service, which was November 10th of 2010."
"Remembering dates and stuff, which I'm terrible at meet Buffet. We went to go watch a movie called due date. Yes. Unfortunately my national service the next day, the next time I saw her was out and we went by the factory of all places again, and this is before. So I need you became Sonia. Chew Direction, shoes are facing when the top really she was outside and I got my stamps already. It feels like it's a drink, man. I took the hint, I saw you before before, the next time you talk about my feet was your reduced, our competition. And then when I did the register, didn't he reached out again? And you said some encouraging words and all the rest is history when we were actually end up together. How would you describe it?"
"You know, I think our friendship has gone through many different phases. I think the friendship that we have now is something soon because we're able to work together and also function as friends outside of work, which, let's face. It is not that, don't you feel you do something but there's a whole that's a whole back story to explain is Potomac real relationship friendship. I think it has to do with respect knowing your place. Putting a pride aside and putting on ego aside to know that. At least for me and my kids like, hey, you know, Sonia. I mean, we we we had opportunity to date a long time ago, you didn't happen but now they were working together. Now that we are close friends. I don't want to break the friendship that we have. Yeah, I think as we carry on this conversation, my opinions on the five, I think I mentioned might come up. The play. The question is, you know, what? It comes through, platonic friendships, right? There's some people that Define it in a way that open Sonic friendships only happened. When"
"Example, you're not attracted to the person anymore. You know what, the other person has their own life and is dating someone else. So do you feel like all friendships between you do men and women? Usually start out with some new love interest. Once again, it might be a physical attraction in my beard, emotional attraction, because when I first mentioned that, you know, the if, for example of platonic, friendship happens because the interest in the other person has died or the other person is dating. Someone someone else has died. I respect the friendship that we have now. I respect my place. I know my place. I say no, I don't think she will."
Get me now. Given how close we are to be so bored over with me.
"It means right leg. Do you feel like even though we're close friends. We do have some fundamental differences that may not work out in a relationship. My locker is very neat now. Okay, I have grown."
"It's neat for a platonic friendship. I feel it to Evolution as well. If you establish like he, I don't see you that way. I don't see you as a boyfriend and girlfriend. It's up to the other person and I'm surprised I'm saying this, but when I was younger, I'll go liked by all the Tom Hansen from a few. Not good enough. I'll beat myself up."
"But, but now, I realize the onus is on me to respect the other person's views, to respect the power of this person. Saying, no, I don't see you that way. And when am I mature enough to establish that in my mind and be friends with this person or go? Like, maybe I need some time to take a step back to, to deplete myself of all attraction for you before I can carry on a friendship. Yeah, fair enough. So anyway, aside from me you have other female friends as well. And how did those friendships or start out? Was it all like frustrated? You know, if anybody is I just thought your companionship or was it like, oh, she's cool. She's cute. Or she was introduced into my group, my two other close, female friends that I had that I have in my life. We met through church. And another friend of mine. We met you partying, at Zoo."
"Is one of the female friend of mine, has it have had together, and if you'll go out, partying, to send it, I think that's respect and the acknowledgement like any motions, but, of course, yes, I do have female friends where I had a massive leans forward and when heat, when she told me or I don't see you that we all know. What do I don't, I think we're better off as friends. You know, what? Give me awhile? Let me know before I can cuz I want to respect your view of me and I hope to earn your respect as well. So this is your, your direction when you hit into a friendship with a girl and it's a right? And then when it comes to, I guess, after you get rid of all of your feelings at your romantic feelings and stuff like that. Do you think things would have changed and does not invite, you know what I mean? Because initially psycho, like, I really like you so much and then after we establish that, can we really be friends? My phone is how you communicate."
"In person, you know, when you become friends, I think that's all over. You can say in jest and develop a better, be ingested. Not like the hopes of trying to change her mind or his mind. So the communication voice might be a lot more."
"Reserve without like, putting in your true emotions, but if you're holding on to that that the hope of pursuing a relationship with someone under the guise of a friendship that I think it's your fault that I take responsibility for that, as well, as some research that was done. But in 2012 at the moment, men and women view, this very differently in the experience, says the opposite sex friendship. We know that the results showed that men are more likely to find a female friends, attractive versus girls finding the male friends attractive. So do you agree with the results and what are your thoughts about my own relationships? Like, I've been in so many rocks and and some of some of these girls, they do have Guy best friends."
"Pictures about that. Personally. I have my reservations about it. But then again, I'm very thankful. Jeremy. Trust me as like, one of your good friends in life and your energy to call. But for the other for the goes, under the Dead Guy, best friends, I as a man, and as a man, I feel like, I know how a man thinks I know what a man is up to and unfortunately in this always happens whenever the guy best friends senses weakness in our relationship. They were right confession. Letter saying that I've always liked you for the longest time, a friendship exists. And unfortunately, because because my like the girls that I've dated, just so close to this guy, also closed the circle of friends where they find it tough to go. Like, hey, you know, I'm seeing someone you can do that, but I respect that. It might affect the entire circle of friends and and there might be awkward feelings before the girl in the guy now,"
"So I wonder what happened to Linda Holliday, get out of that. So then if you don't mind sharing how did that end up using? Some of the girls couldn't couldn't bear to break. The guy best friends. Yeah. I ended up being the victim of this where they said, Hey, Joe, I know. Can we take some time off? Like, why do why do you think sometime unless unless they will all that was? Also, that sense of curiosity. Like actually, you know, what would have happened if I date him given how we're all good, friends already know what I mean by friends of all day that you can, they continue to be friends after that. I'm not quite sure how I feel about who is the ex of my other friend in the whole in the same Social Circle."
"Really, really comes into play. Here is on the tonic friendships and relationships changed over the years, has, it always remain the same or you feel that you've matured and grown in a way where, you know, what I think I can accept, if my future girlfriend, has a male best friend and I am able to iron out the issues within my own insecurities speaking. If I know that my female, my, my partner has a, has a male best friend. I would like to meet them, your best friend. I would like to establish this form of unspoken. Like, hey, I respect you as the meal best friend. You don't cross the boundary if she has an issue. If she has a problem. I would like to be the presents there for her, you know, if she needs to contact shoulder to cry on, you might, you might think it's me being immature of me being possessive, but if she needs to come fish with a crayon, I feel that I should be the number one product returns. Do not why, why have me as a partner to stick your guy? Best friend."
"Does Bette Midler if there's a weakness in our relationship. If it's Rocky or I, I don't wish for you to become the Comfort dick to cry on. I feel we should allow us to establish communication, how to better our relationship first, then you can maybe stop in an Oscar. How's it going? But unless, of course, if if my my girlfriend approaches the guy, best friend and my girlfriend made the first and now I have a question that you can't answer very honestly and I will also answer very honestly on the question is, have you ever dated a girl that had a problem with me?"
"Yes, I have heard that silence was deafening. This was this was 2014 2015 2016 and initially for Sony and I at work from January to April 2014 with both of us signing of a different working style. But I feel that the arguments we saw was supposed to have as a reader Dewar's, a Showbiz duo. We had it very early on the careers and ever since then I think so. And I we had mutual respect for each other as people and his colleagues. And the closer we are as people it reflects on the show and it got a lot better. If we did. A lot of YouTube videos together with the interviews together. Whenever I post a picture of Hill, on on on Instagram. It's one of mutual mutual respect and love. I love this girl very much ever since April 2014."
"And people that I was sitting at that point, they got sick and tired of their friends asking them. Oh my gosh, I need to come from Step together one, where they come from the dollar for every comment, which one you can show you. I'm, I'm quite uncomfortable with the closet. If you are together, when we clearly State on all the comments that come in, say, I ship a long time ago. So yeah, but the strange thing is the girls who told me they were uncomfortable with you being my good female friend. They had Guy best friends of Their Own."
"Their Guy best friends of their own and do openly. No sleep on your shoulder during a Christmas, getting you for stealing the length of the gutter, what's going on? Then I blame myself a latte, or maybe maybe I'm not good enough. Maybe I'm not trying hard enough. Maybe? Maybe maybe not in good job."
"But yeah, I'm not perfect. I have my own flaws as well. So, yeah, I have dated, since you shut, I'll share as well as a threat to every someone that I did. It had a problem."
I think I know who.
"Okay, for this particular guy. I mean we're on good terms. By the way, when good terms we actually are actually friends friendship. Can you be friends with your ex? But you know, I think is he did actually raise it up in an instant arguments. When you do everything still on the carpet and everything, just blows up in a big confrontation. It was those moments that he brought up the issue of joking and I hate being too close as partners through that experience with that. I really need like a self-assured, confident partner. What is quiet? I would say unusual to a lot of people who are not in this line for sovaldi and you know, who do maybe office jobs. They don't have a partner in life. You have to have chemistry with and bounce off."
"With every day, so it really takes, selfie short, confident, man, to be able to understand our work to respect that. And to be, let you know what? I'm not going to feel insecure, just because we're always joking and laughing and you seem to finish each other's sentences all the time. But do you think of the end of the day that it's useful and helpful to have female best friends for perspective? For, I don't know what the different type of emotional support or sure. We have very different Dynamics, you know, I can see like when both hang out with each other versus girls hang out with each other and then when you come and get it. What do you think is very good to have a best friend, a member of the opposite sex? Because the amount of time she has helped me understand a female's perspective and your mama times that I have helped to understand a male's perspective of those rare times louder. Idea, but you need to be ready for this. You you need to tell us of your just friends our respective. We we have love for"
"Each other not in that romantic way, but in the end that we, we're both of us, our mutual mutual friends, and I understand that it won't evolve into anything more than that last year. Where the groom's best? Man. I remember I recalled the best woman speech. She said, like it when I first met his dead girlfriend. Now fiance, no wife. I will be uncomfortable. But once the trust was established, it was great. This very Progressive as well as I that people don't talk about this because it is the topic of a lot of fights. I feel between couples and you know, between friends even friendship fall apart, groups of friends, you don't get into arguments because of certain things like that. To be honest. I feel the fights happened because perhaps one of the parties could have been a victim of being cheated on or the guy with the girl."
"Best friend tries to put on Jalen cuz my insecurities stem from that, and it took me awhile to really accept the notion of a guy best friend. So do you think that men and women can be friends? I'm going to answer this like a history student. Yes. I feel like a broken record. It really boils down to a lot of important factors. Can you put? Can you put your pride aside? Can you establish respect with each other? I think these three so I can try and go to go to ask yourself that if not, you might not be ready. That's my opinion, but about yours comment, but in other words, it's not a simple black or white on Sir. There are some conditions there that. Yes, but we have to make an effort to the last question that I have is you supposed to send it to just put us an awkward position. And the question is, what is one thing we love about each other."
"It's okay. How do I just break down? So nice. You into one adjective or a noun? Just keep it simple. I summarized, how many things you left? What I love about Sonia is hard. Drive to be the best at what she does. Yeah, it's a mirror. Give me a call back. I'm that kind of person whatever chance that comes to me. I want to make sure I'm driven it enough to be the best at what I do. When it, when I'm with her. We have the same mindset of hey, you know what, radio show hosting this get-together for hosting and EP together. Let's let's just give it our best shot Kick-Ass, create an impact, and then we celebrate the Victory and then go back into working hard again. And I think that's the one thing I love about her. And it's a call factor. That brings us closer together as colleagues and his friends."
"Could use a free as soon as you put it very, very well. But similarly, I think the one thing that I want to add on to that as well, aside from, you know, what the similar drive that we have hot water. Can you put in an all your somebody that doesn't give up easily? And I really think that that is a good quality as well because to me sometimes and it doesn't work out and I feel like I get it later like I just want to toss it away or give up or whatever. But if you only give him another few minutes to tell you about the story about how you got here, and it's to cling onto this opportunity to leave grab it, you know, by the horns and stuff like that. I think that's one thing. That is a really good quality and in regards to relationships, you know, the kindness that he has and the amount of care. He has a new shows for his other partner is something that you know, you should really consider if you're single and ready to mingle."
"A whole like learning to never give up, kind of think it's gotten to a point in my life. Now with, pick your battles wisely because if we going to fight for everything and not give up this, you're going to get very drained. I kid you not the determination and in the strength as well. So I think that's what I really makes us work as friends. And this has felt like an extended radio program for those actually being closer now after this revelation,"
"I mean, you don't feel like we learn something new."
"If you enjoyed the video as well, please like and share the video and subscribe to a channel and leave a comment below telling us whether you agree or disagree and suggest the next topic for a darling. So I'll meet you in. The meantime is X. A b, b y."
Okay.
I think it's like maybe a regular honey. I could be wrong.
Just found that one needs to be sugary. But this and a bit more Florida profiles with two jobs. You probably never heard off to tell us what they do and how they got here in a truth or dare for MIT each profile with your question cards from the deck of the hot. Truth about that profession. For every question that they cannot answer. They will have to perform a surprise death as an alternative. Hello romance abuse while living
"How did be amazed. I was a white screen and just like the movie item, and I was stung by some bees. And I become a millionaire. In five years ago. I was latest song by be. I'm an educated at heart as a result. I was thinking so many things I could do with these, especially to a Decatur, Singapore is not be afraid of being discovered, the work of a beekeeper beekeeper. Looks after the Beast the second test by bees and then you are so caught. A beekeeper by in Singapore. We have a challenge because we can I buy these at basically know me keeping industry in Singapore. So what I do, I grill can be just like, I might be some people don't want to be seen the house and schools are in factories and they call me, and I will kill the Beast and I'll bring them to be a Miss cotton. What did your friends and family thing? When you told them, you decided to quit your job as a history and Western Swift become a beekeeper."
To say I was crazy. I'm 52 this year at a time. I was 57 my friend to tell me why don't you just stay in your current job and then go for a nice retirement. Why are you so crazy? You want to do something? That's so I know not and what do you know about beekeeping? You may be able to teach PE Science and Mathematics High School?
"But then I was so obsessed with be no objection to stop me from doing what I wanted to do. I'm a dedicated for 37 years. I so whatever. Good values. Do you want to impact on the students? You know how the student development can learn from the Beast and I thought I could use beekeeping to encourage people from the country to have lived that life who I was thinking. Maybe I could even start that model. Village Inn, Division. I had what I could possibly do with these two old women. I had to leave. Or do I love teaching? I love being with schools and teachers. This is my fourth year as a professional beekeeper, whatever reason I had five years ago that all fit in your life at Ixtapa. Now baby. I'm on my way. I mean, you prepare your retirement route to my second career actually."
"Is this a completely removed from an ecosystem? Affect us? And think, a lot of people would be diving on vibration and beautiful security actually be pollinated by bees. So whenever you see some food and Dad cut blind test to swim for a guess, which one is yours, by the way, the one I brought my regular, honey."
Okay.
"I think they said I can maybe a regular, honey."
I could be wrong.
"I think this is more the honey. I brought this song. That one is a bit Sugaree by the sound a bit more Florida and it's Mustafa and not too overpowering share. The biggest misconception. People have about your career in bookkeeping here in Singapore about me to the misconception is B, how to stimulate and have two hammers when will want to come to my garden? I say hello. Yeah, what is sweet? And you know, the flower. So don't worry to be coming to you. But an occasion is something to be said, come to us as a c on a hot day and sweating. So that should it be so, and then on a body on a head and face even just a drink from a sweat. So my advice is letting me come to your hand and they say, hope I'm the chosen one and use that moment to admire how to beat a drinking from the sweat minute or so when they have that few will fly away. If you don't come out of trees and go near the Beast. Why would it be bored and"
"Share house. Are we in the career? I think I don't have any hair story. I have. You don't have a health threat, can draw a deck sing a baby song theme song. When are my visitors, come to be amazed, Kaden a Chevy than me, how to live in harmony with Abby, how to prevent themselves from getting stung by bees to make an attitude. I'm sick of video test to know, fast movement and then I don't stand in a fight by the Beast and generally if you do that and then you're okay. I always hang out with this new song by the honey song. Okay, and he goes by that."
"Honey, in the morning, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey. I love you all."
"ASP and Giovanni singing this song to some of the kindergarten kids that's before creep pink overtime and you see them all dancing, the jumping up and down and I miss those times, true or false beekeeping can be fulfilling career. Of course, look at me. I'm so happy now. I'm so I'll be friendly. I hope to see more corporate entities organization Gardens or the rooftop, whatever areas they can change the size. Sentosa, Golf Club, make it sustainable, make it be friendly."
"That's if you'll only the King on a unique profession. No, I think that's how many beekeepers are without over the world when you're upset with you or not. There's no loneliness in contact with many, many more people all over Singapore and all over the world."
Call Juan De La Cruz friends and convince them to have a career in beekeeping. Okay. Who do I call to find out? What are you doing at the moment?
"Everything a video in front of a computer, right? What you like to go to the exciting world of the Bees and Honey and then you can have with a honey. I'm good honey, right? Wouldn't that be wonderful?"
"Said, I can we see the picture of a beekeeper. Thank you. Thank you. I miss all y'all on my girlfriend's name. My girlfriend's name of female. Be the queen is a female Nobel, committee's opinion, and the drones will be sunny during the meeting season 2, The Beast musician, then do all the hard work. So I want to honor that female. I naming all my bee hives, keeping a few minutes in the Beast, play at the rising. They just built something out. Nothing to nominee from the honeycomb fungus plant at the entrance of the way back here. So my job is to make them happy and then hopefully they built one more honeycombed with the back of the show. I hope you've learned something about me. Please like And subscribe to this channel. Thank you so much. Bye. Bye."
"In her, what is a sub series on something? Private featuring lesson on stories from women who have survived pains? And like what most of us go through and triumphed women who succeeded despite and Against All Odds? This is that sorry."
"I am a looking female who are circumcised as a child and I now have differing opinions about it. Since, when I first discovered that I was like Jesus."
"He said the reason why I use the term s sizes because it's more of a mutual what as opposed to the usual. Like if me and Tina generation because I guess even like I'm about to smoke and fire his how to say hi. I am a missing female and I was mutilated at my genitals, maybe like later. Like"
"That's not even correct. Because you understand it that comes when that right is like a normal come, he's right. Yeah, so it is as me is even more unusual than saying that was like circumcised is as long as you know, is a lot of people know that, you know, guys go through soon and everything and a lot of people with the family and I'm going to know that thang guys have to go through the circumcision process. But not a lot of girls know about that broom Vine witches like females like"
"Honestly, my feelings at this time, I've never really had any opposition to it because growing, you know, you were still smelling like Pee Wee, Herman shows or whatever. And then there's this scene where, you know, all the boys are wearing that like kind gesture like something and they're all like preparing to go into the school. And so it is like something that is no more. So I didn't think that there is any issue with it until I guess I started going to school at Union and like I realize that old female circumcision is not like people don't know that they were certain, he's dead of night time soon. Was that you didn't have any negative connotations until I reach that you didn't realize that it has a negative impact on the people of most people. Colored female, genital, mutilation, SEC, female genital, cutting from what I understand, a different extent to, which of the Conoco, if you answer the extent of the cutting or how much that is removed."
"Different in different cultural context from what I understand. We just barely made it but it's only based on my experience a lot of like those my age talk about it is that in Singapore? Only. That is a very small incision and it's like also what my parents tell me a song of minority groups, less privileged less empowered to have a space among the majority to have the voices and the issues be her. And that's why he was in the chair with my own opinions, but I think this is the episode that is on the red, contentious topic. And I'm sorry, but I have to interact with some sex just to set the record straight. I did my reading online and then I rode into several Muslim, female, gynecologist base in Singapore because I want to understand what exactly is type of female circumcision that is carried out here. Today, really one reached back to me and he answered"
"She is the kind to be named because it is a really sensitive topic back home. But if you did a quick Google search, I'm sure you could find her when she expressed concern immediately over the fact that I was going to do this episode because she thought that the word mutilation of the end that was carried out. That home was very, very different from what's happening today, in Africa on research on female genital mutilation and it works closely with African underprivileged women, finding stuff all types of Mutilation that one, two, three, and four for the most common in Southeast Asia, with the prick scraper, partially removed, the Pinterest button every day, sometimes to a combination of many things, including scraping and then swing up the vagina. Doctor disagrees updated. This information is with relation to self."
"Asian mutilation for many, many years now, she vouches for the fact that female circumcision that exists in Singapore. Today is not practice in a physical way and it's largely a symbolic practice to enable a rite of passage really, really late. So I pushed her to tell me what exactly, she meant specifically does it mean that you know, they don't like what you said. Is it just a simple free explained to me that person can only either visit their GP or gynecologist to carry out this practice. What this means is that the sole responsibility for carry out the circumcision, fell on the shoulders of heat up this. They could not come up to publicly condemn, his actions because they were still in the man for this to be carried out. And if they refuse to do it, who knows what legal or a magic practice might result causing more harm to young lady, right? So that it will not be physically carried out."
"Send its 99.9%. Symbolic parents, bring the child to a clinic and they go through a prayer for Lord by the procedure where the doctor, replace a prick or knife on the clitoris. Nothing. No, sexing. Somebody who is in her mid-20s and it's difficult to confirm what procedure. She had gone through as child care, much about the specifics. But like, you don't even like, I don't remember what I was like, 7 size and according to my mommy, know when she was telling me stories. Is that, do you know, that's okay. I said baby. I just saw a penny in this procedure. I didn't write that you didn't cry, but you'll not like she cried. But even though she cried like she couldn't because, you know, I didn't you just ask someone to be able to go to pee and buy the same time. She still believes that we still need to go through it and sooner."
"Which I really do understand now be contacting him because I had a different view before and after uni, and I recent things that happen. So that you didn't have ended. They didn't want to have an opinion on it. I just like, okay, this thing happens and I think that a lot of people like, blocked it out of proportion sometimes. But then I think, after I took some Chinese astrology, took some more deals in health and then let him know about it and added people this. I kind of changed my stance, was it also with my own experience as though they don't remember it happening, right? So they don't physically feel the pain, you know, I may be more sensitive more work. I'll let you know a way of like social cultural issues. That's awesome that you know, like yeah, like"
"Sorry, I think it's. There. She goes. Maybe The Quiet Ones. Me. Not, you know, why that you didn't even know about it. And yeah, it may or may not affect them know that even though she cries when his head was me. Why did you still want to go through it? It cuz she said that it is like, compulsory and it's needed because it helps to cut your sexual desires. Yeah, isn't the fact that they're trying to control it. You know, I I really am very opposed to that lock."
"When my mom told me, I mean I already knew from likes. But yeah, I just only had an issue with it and you need to talk about these issues. So she asked me how come only in your knee. I had an issue about it because it's just like fun and I'm like, yeah, I know. No big deal. Yeah, so I told her that and then she was exposed to have things and I was like I asked no big deal. And then I guess sometimes you know, when in my Asian on the news looking for this easy as people writing and thought, you know, you lied about any kind of like it from your Viewpoint that it's not like I really balanced perspective."
"I don't want it to be like that, just because something is different and different cultures and you need and I guess maybe my partner changed also. So this was a little like to Chinese boyfriend. And then, I guess, one thing was an issue in our relationship. A lot of other thing was that he didn't like to have sex. I was wondering what year was teasing me and then secondly, like"
"So anyways, I fight the blood and they broke up and then after we broke up, he was such a dick because I always be like and then he's like I'll ask him at all. Like I want to tell you, I like. Okay. Yeah, and then he never talked about it and all that. So then I guess, you know, he doesn't care about my feelings. So he said that he didn't enjoy sex with me. And then I was like, are you serious? And then he said that he's not used to, like the circumsized."
"Night, I was like, okay, so I just forgot he doesn't do everything else. So, anyway, I think you both arrived and I was just being very sexually incompatible after that. I'll definitely call her."
Calendar. For some of them that I said talk to me and I'm supposed to just friends. I just asked him to let you know. Is there a difference? Like because I'm circumcised or whatever and and they were like the hell there's no difference at all. As long as mine. Are you just hanging out with attorney has whatever? She has something that I am still like figuring out how to navigate.
So good on you.
But taking a short break.

"Now, back to that store."
"I guess most girls would only realize when the other is, because that's when you start thinking about, like,"
"What? I don't know what it is that you do anything about when I do have a kid. I'm not lying and what happened to them, but that's when they start talking about exposed to it. I guess, the reason why I can't, because my mom, just just talks about it. Going to get. Do you know when y'all located it is happened and it was like"
"Write a story to tell about when we were when I was a baby and I grew up until before I went to you knowing that to me. Yeah, so, I'm sure that Dad and then they might be okay and doesn't in time when it comes to find it, you know, a lot of people then say that was that really okay. Okay. So yeah. Yeah, I don't know, but he's my best friend cuz she look like she's on both sides. Right? She was like, you didn't care at all then. Now he's like, oh, you know what it is."
"If like, I mean, I wonder the same thing in a society than you wouldn't question it, right? It's just that because different culture, the stupid thing. I guess this is viewed negatively because it is associated with the seventh kind of like violence in a way and it's been kind of like physical harm done to someone like the reason why I say that is cuz I ain't right now."
"So yeah, I think that is also why it's difficult to to stop it, but I think that in general, it should."
"It shouldn't be stopped. I'm not, I'm not going to be like super like loud and vocal about it."
"Maybe the reason why is because I don't want to see, I don't have the social Fabric and I don't want. Do you know sometimes you just get so sick of the way. People said, I do, you know, Melissa Faria silent on censored. It's all the same. Types and I saw you do another one on there. So I don't know. I think I want thing I learned in. So see is a sizeable minority group or disadvantage to plant get too angry sometimes right? Like, yeah, but you need to come from that object. Is you blind from Malena voice as well to come and get to the other side? Like this is why this has gotten over there yet. They cannot be helped but the other reasons why people are not being so vocal about it. Yeah, I mean, since there's no health benefits and people rather not do it and they're like message you were doing it then."
"Why not even while you waste your time going to the doctor and I'm doing this to your kid and then like putting yourself through the emotional pain and then your kids through the physical pain is eventually. There's no benefit the cultural sort of like regulatory Authority right sit that they don't encourage it in anyway. Yeah, but at the same time,"
"I think not many people would know and I can maybe other people may have a different Viewpoint that, you know, this. But usually has like Mom and, you know, this is what is a menswear thing is I and then even though this female circumcision thing, you know, both parents all the time with friends, know, that happens to the female child. Usually it comes from a case of the mom or grandma or be like the men would not."
"Why did have a say in this mess with me? So I don't like for them kids and the boys get circumcised, right? But for the female is, I don't think that is something that"
"Like they have some opinions about it, small about the females and then maybe they're coming from oil scented and that's why they wanted to be done to get kids and nothing alike, you know, of any kind of way more of like, this is how it's supposed to be done. When was like a mobile advertising, sign up and then second was attacked, like it was just me and my boss that time isn't have longer friends, but I never understood, you know, like I just never liked, you know, I wouldn't do it. And then right when I was in LA, I saw like Ed's will let you know people to protect themselves from to be like for those that are having gay sex and everything and then she'll let you know Tool Guy."
"It's like in a Subway at it, like this every day when he would have loved it. So my opinion through that event. I do love, nice setup Checkers, on 7th, on Dunns, and then a lot of social impact event and especially like women let you vent, and I'm done with those minorities and they'll be very vocal and then, yeah, and then also, I went for the physical borders and like that and that you that you and kind of like top three with her back panel discussions over like really big D this and then,"
"Why do you get stuck with me? From what this one particular panel discussion was a person in the audience was saying that we need to get on the streets. And you know, like you never posted and let you know what the book about his activism and stuff and then the guy in the pan always like some thing. Like, I mean, yeah, you can do that. I mean, in terms of the impact that it has, right? It's not as much as, for example, when you're doing stuff in that policy and research and stuff. So that's a lot. And then when I got back from you, I was doing a social movement and activity. That is so awesome, like going to visit some Integrity activism like the streetlights, the whole Wall Street and stuff and then"
"And then there's also the benefits of the policy cycle has definitely should talk more about it and also be open again cuz I'm sure that, you know, maybe sometimes if I can pay my stupid, everything I should send something and then you know that, you know, I'm sure there or is it because I was circumcised, then I cannot feel like, you know, whatever like maximum treasure and I think I can just talk about. It is is Smith and I don't want to explore that. I think moving forward a lot more people as more people start talking about it and realize that on a"
No benefits to it. I think that it is moving in the direction. We're less and less people will do it. Yeah.
"This has been an episode on female circumcision in Singapore. It's really interesting to me because if you did a quick search, there's not a lot has been covered on it in a Southeast Asian contacts and I have to go. See, even suggest that people are still comfortable with it back home. It's a larger issue at hand when it comes to this topic of circumcision is really what it represents. The removal of sexual desire from the bodies, better is really very dangerous. And even if she made them into, not wanting to know about what's going on inside, can be very dangerous and fantasy still largely exist within conservative, southeast Asia, no matter the religion. I think it's something that has to be addressed. So if you guys have learned something a bit from this episode, I hope that you bring this educational piece of information and pasta."
"Siblings, siblings, nieces and nephews, if your friends have children, if you have children on to the next Generation so that we can be a more educated and informed generation in society."
"Who was quite interesting that people don't even know how to ask you to lend a listening ear. What they really want is to spend time and talk about what they going through. But people are not able to voice and say, Amen. Listen, can we go for drinks tonight? I have something to talk about what is wrong with showing your body."
Did your best position that can fit inside?
It's expanding. You got angry.
"What time is the rain in today? We are on ground at the Singapore, Cancer Society clinic. And I'm going to be getting a pap smear. Now. I'm very, very sad today cuz my girls cannot be here with me. So I decided to use technology and bring them in on a live dunny."
"I miss you girl, so much too. But you know what, even though we are apart, we have to do our iconic intro. Are you guys ready?"
"Okay, we wanted to get a Pap smear done together. But because of the messages, we were unable to help you about those who hold the podcast called behind podcast and a one of the episodes Facebook about. Health and stuff like that. And I said it's been my experience on pap smear and that was when I realized that these two girls have not gotten two pet cats yet guilty as charged but at least one of us is going to get today. And Jimmy's going to take us through the entire journey of the pets me up. I'm feeling a bit nervous excited, but you don't having you guys here with me. It just makes me feel so much better. I don't know how much you're going to see of everything today. But I feel like we're going to be very, very good friends after today. Their pets me. All right, will you prepared in the sense that you waxed shaved or you went for laser treatment?"
I wasn't.
"Okay, let me explain myself. I went in thinking that I was just going to go for a normal consultation with Dr. I did not know that I could get the pat smear done that and then so I was not prepared at all. But I think the doctor has seen like in a vagina is in her life that she didn't seem to care. So I'm like, okay, let's get it."
A little boys and little girls.
"But you don't pass me. It is one of the best foods to detect, pre cancer and early-stage cervical, cancer, as ovarian butterflies, and we didn't know what time to put information as well. So we hope that, you know, if you're in the same word is us, this video will help you. So we're going to find out all about Paris yesterday. Why is it important stuff? Call Kenza, how can we prevent it? And even things like, what is the prime age that you should be doing this test and Jack exactly. So without further Ado, go, if I'm going to bring you into the clinic with me and the whole crew as well. And we are going to open up my cervix and see what's in there."
Where it's at?
"Say hi to doctor about Donna. Eye doctor love. I am very nervous. This is your advice and to relax. Okay. And just focus on deep breathing. Exactly. I think, you know, a lot of viewers are pasteurized deserves to know how you should be getting a lot of times, right there. What procrastinate? So if you have friends, I would encourage you and you don't get you the support at 2 to call my friends want to see my vagina."
"How long is this procedure going to take less than a minute to Minute Timer? Right? Is it how the procedure is like? Okay, I'm going to use this instrument is called when you see a plastic disposable ones."
"So are you going to open it up slightly so that I can visualize your cervix? And then there's something else. Something is going in case I'm going to use the self trash by Jesse s w. O r k. I think preservative solution will be sent to the lab. I see interesting. OK Google history search that you need any long-term medication. Right. Now I have nothing serious surgery, surgery in The Logical conditions."
"Have you had your HPV vaccination, though? I have not had my HPV vaccination. And I know you have to get it by 26, right now. You want to get this out? But otherwise, there's no need to write. So if there's no issues we can proceed with, this is okay to start. My cervix is in your hands, literally all the way near the edge of the bed, or lie to the edge of the bed tonight and I put your feet on the stereo."
"It's okay, baby girl."
"I need you to relax. Okay, drop by as much as if you and all the way to the sky is what I'm getting a Brazilian."
Best position.
"Okay, so just focus on your breathing. Take the speculoos is going in right now. But what is it called inside?"
Is expanding your guy is expanding.
Okay.
"Okay, I think that's simple. Stick is inside. I can feel it throbbing against my cervix uncomfortable. It's already is done. But I just need to do a quick examination to check your uterus and your ovary. But now she's doing a check of the user annual examination is a manual examination, manual self-check. She's pressing on my womb and ovaries as okay. Well, that's all. Alright. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for making me feel so comfortable with the whole procedure. How soon can I expect to know the results results to you in about 4 to 6 weeks? Time? Is there any abnormalities that requires? Further investigation? I'll give you a call earlier."
"C. Okay, so 4 to 6, next time you get out of a report telling you the levels is that you will get the report as a laboratory report as well as a notification letter to tell you want to do the next test results. And normal. It would be 3 years. Okay, if there's some inflammation or some infection, you may be asked to come back earlier today about this month. So I guess so. I was just want to have a chat with you in a bit more about, you know, cats as pets Mia HPV. So fussy. What is a pap? Smear is Ikea laboratory tests? Where by the pathologist examines the cells that is taken from a woman's cervix. So the pathologist who examined for any abnormal changes in a Cell, which they signify early changes that will lead to some type of cancer."
"Okay, right. So if Bebe hasn't kept as a pet simulator, right next to be, the procedure is the same exactly the same only in the lab, finna passed me looking at a Speedy Taxi. We looking for the virus itself of HPV virus. We went to take the cells on the cervix. We wind up the cells to be here as Charis and Keen as a possible. So it's best to schedule your pap. Smear two weeks after your first day of your man. Says he can feel like treating for women who have attained menopause and they can do it anytime. Okay. So this is basically a model of what happened to your cervix when you get cervical cancer, right? The normal cervix is a Saturday. This is the normal cervix. Okay. Nothing is here. Okay."
"Which is easily visible, and this is early. Why we call non invasive cancer locate has involved in a slightly, a biggest circumference. So this is a early stage invasive cancer. It means that the cancer has spread. All right, be on the external surfaces of the cervix and he has gone to a different issue. And this is the latest age invasive cancer. It may have invaded the surrounding tissue include in your vagina and perhaps your movements may be down here. All right, when you have any symptoms, like what part of being a little after intercourse, you may have abnormal bleeding in between your menses. So when you have the sentence you need to see a doctor or a Bentley and get investigator so important."
"If I have just one sexual partner, but it's fault. But if you have just one partner and you, each have just one partner with a virus going to come from,"
"Why? I don't know. Okay, don't answer to somebody who has multiple sexual partners. But so you still need to get screen. I don't need to get a pet test."
"If you still want to find out, so I'm going to go with for women that have the HPV vaccine, they don't need to go for her. So I thought it was pretty, like, well-rounded and stuff over six months is the same vaccine over three doses. However, it doesn't cover all strains of HPV. Other high-risk HPV only protecting its 17 to 90%. So there's still that 10 to 30% that you need to screen. Okay, so we have just one last week. I feel like we know the answer after today, cervical cancer cannot be prevented Gulf."
10

"I can't think of any other couple in a same-sex relationship in Singapore, that has a child. So how did you guys do it? So we know what she said. We need a GF, because we've always wanted kids. So we're not legally married, even though we really hope that one day, we can be legally, married in Singapore. But if you want to go overseas to get a marriage certificate in on it, when we come back to Santa Paula, Sue not recognize. So use that wedding fund for baby making processes. And we love kiss a lot, which is why we specialize in kids events company together for the pasta dinner and we just to let you know. We love you so much. Having a child is like I must do for us. Every we threw that we cannot just because of our sexual orientation. I just admitted to being the best. You're the best teacher to anybody where we wanted to have a family of our own, and I guess our family unit is what's different from everyone else. But other than that,"
"Fuse for, you know, we've thought of having a kid ever since, like, 10 years ago. How are you guys now, so, sorry, save up, and you just waiting for the right time to start my life with you guys. Maybe she'll find the right one day. You'll have been together for this year."
"Relationship. We have a couple of people that's above that. We are really close to that are in a relationship for 1617. Yes. We have a relationship and I guess one of the reason why we can be together for so long is because number one will come and go when you let whatever kids together last together. So even though in terms of years is a 6in something. Yeah. Right by us. Cause we work together. We leave together. Basically, we are just together. 24/7, mention that you want that, you both knew you want the kids since you are in your like, I want to have kids, but, you know, I'm, I'm sure of like my sexual orientation to. I guess when you guys are out today."
"Each other for quite some time. So we starting a family. Came to ask, Do you know how to go about doing it? And then I will do some research and found that we can do it was quite apparent to us that we really want to do. We start family. How do we do? It is more like a, okay. I think we're going to stop at me. Like how much does it cost and I will be ready to try sebi of tries before we see that we've giving her. But before that we just filled it because age is catching up with. You don't want to be parents at a very early age that my mom gave birth to me when she was when you on"
"So now I'm 34. My mom is only 55. I can see that she's really enjoying her life. Now. She can go for trips on on her own with her friends without bothering her ass and that's why you wanted level cheat or lie then somehow. Now, I feel like I'm sorry for my mom was my age. I was reading in PSL and IVF process. You was it something that you guys stop by there are other options available at Lee vs a small invasive because we have two extra extra."
"As well because of that. Then I think that I like this a lot lower which is why I feel all that's why I said that we might have to take like a hormone injections. And then, injected for a couple of days before the eggs are ready to be received and extracted, right? Is it the same? Yeah, that's what we had to do. We have to do every day for you. I will see you at 5."
"I mean that we do not want to ask a married, couple about all the pressure, somebody to having children. You never know someone around you could be trying for years and they are not successful and someone probably has some so whatever making it hard for them to consider as well. So from then we decided that we should not ever popped into asking. When do they want to have kids? You know, sometime today. I have a lot of struggles and he don't know if you are the one taking the Jet and a whole bunch of you get lost side effect with like writing mood swings side effects, like a weight gain and everything. We went through together because we have heard of a lot of couples during the training process. Sometimes, you know, maybe has my wife or whatever."
Sacrifices in order to do it overseas as a lot closer than we expected during the process of trying. We also have a shelf like there's a difference between you being a same-sex couple versus like a heterosexual couple in going through that the IVF process has a little bit of difference because so we both know what mood swings are cramps. I know what is the Fall Guy and I know I express how I feel you do at 2 and I'll let her know that we're helpless and she knows how I'm feeling the same time.
"The whites are the ones stepping themselves. Yeah, but philosophy has been with each other throughout the entire process to tell me about how you guys felt after 4, when you guys realize that he was a very emotional, even when we think about it. So, heartbroken after that, I were crying, like, the whole way back. Then, the second time we come from can Indian again. So, it was like a lot of emotional roller coaster comes to the adult heart weigh."
"Cuz there's so many things that can happen in a stamp right now. I'm so paranoid, right? Everyday feeling. Well. She moved us to. Okay, inside, cuz, you know, I've been told that happens for every mother who is pregnant, but she did. What was the carrier on the real biological mom? So, she's the one that did the day we come back, we have our guy needs a ball. That's helping us a thing. The team is quite professional."
"Situation, right from the start. So the nursing team and the doctor knew about same-sex, family Union, and they were very professional about it. The whole time West patient. I'm just paying for the patient. She's just there is a history of everything about searching for somebody who is very outdoorsy. And I mean health-wise Academy twice, everything is okay because it's so shallow. It's just because"
"Niece and nephews a mix. I see your family can accept a mixture already. So since I guess you like the brightness engine you like for you guys. I think everybody's complaining about that school is kind of like a. We don't know whether it will. We will actually be pregnant at any point time. So the fact that we are pregnant, this is like the best thing that ever happened to me, even though when we look at her as she does something about, I probably always. Because of their societal pressure Family furniture and stuff like that."
"Okay, how was your side if you ask? How will, how will we be treated and stuff like that? Until now we're still being worried about? How is she going to cope with school? How she going to court with other kids are other kids parents before we started trying? But you know, how, how to how do we hook, Robin, simple way? It's not so intrusive at the moment. So we migrated, should we do this? We do that. And I realize that this is where I root sign, this is what how do I have a child? Despite not having many, many people around us with kids, and send it in Easter, in the process of Heaven. Whatever seems right? Like the one you have. Is there been any difficulties in that? They all go to like a doctor. And then I guess that your face,"
"Push back from different sections of society. And in the Doctor Who stuff that we were like, we have to get separate insurance because I'm just an outsider and everything will be provided."
"Yep, they won't happen to correct. What will happen to an Indian? Which is why we were in Family Support. Like, we tried sending the big planner. The reason why we have this because you want to let me know for sure. If anything happened to me, they'll be provided for anything happens to, but then I will be able to care for her. Yeah, I see you understand that brand new."
"According to whatever we have talked about such as like what happened to our company or happen to us. If we touch I passed away everything, Okay. I just want to do it because now that I know of other couples who can do it as want to do it, and then just go ahead without thinking about all. This is difficult in time to come, not because they shoes, you need me slow as long as we love her. And she knows that with you that, you know, yourself."

"I mean intentions, but they are really just curious where and how it can be done. So it's more like what we feel that we need to especially if it's people that we were over and over again, like for Reno to coffee shop and we want to order a plate of food and Auntie, are you wanting on the couch?"
"There's always a reaction. She will see them as she grow up and do your store is always going to be there. We are always quite accepting when, you know us as people. We are surprised that the older generation other ones that are more accepting of all to understand the concept of IVF. How do you try and on it? Then? They are very supportive. And also I don't feel like I'm not welcome when i n do anyway, but these are the people that way. If it's just a stranger people who don't know, you are, right?

I need to make this independent decision. What were your family's reaction?"
"And then yeah, I think I just thought of our relationship. Our families probably thought that, you know, it's going to be a passing face on it. I mean, I'm also surprised but I always remember helping bring me to a family. So we met the first day and the next second, it doesn't want to discuss Tycoon. She just brought me in and then I just mean go to the family. So always remember how she just bring me to the family without, you know, sharing that she cannot show me to anyone."
"At the high school, because she didn't like me, then. I felt like, I should have had her too. So, yeah. Yeah, we just bring each other to our families. She's just super close or whatever. But the question, how, how long are we going to be never marry and start a family."
"Decided this is the time to start trying. We wanted to make sure that father knows that we love her and we don't want to deny her so we don't want to just go ahead and try for a baby without letting any family members know. And also we feel like maybe people will think about trying to cover up. Maybe she had a one night stand and she told me that she got a baby so you don't want people to be discussed with my family or friends. We let them know our plans before we even went for our process, your parents. They just know I'm still 10 years ago. Right down to help. So from then we decided at the feeling."
"So, one day, I decided to have this."
"How we doing? Okay, so it's kind of like a serious. You need to stop thinking about life. But I do, we stand firm on the fact that we are going to be with each other for long just like any other couple. I mean, of course, we can't tell what the future, holds me back out and stuff. But at this point of time, we want to be with each other is good. Enough already have one more child. Why you don't want to have a kid, but then again because you're just worried about how we"
"I know that for sure. Okay, okay, he changes things for the family to do. So quite was it? Because I guess that's a way to show that she's supposed to call you but it's more fun than being a poly process. And also anticipating the the positive. Maybe they don't tell people that this is Doug Rancho. Then what happens if maybe you wanted you, I was happy about it and I'll call it come along and then they just pretend stranger."
"Don't say who stalks. And we started to realize that, you know, the questions that we should anticipate is not just the two of us. So we decided to see everyone. He's watching you, answer saying. Yeah, I can bring her to my mom's work place and her colleague all know that she has two moms. And I guess I know we are at Southridge what make you a rest of his decision to have a child? Because this house in the sun. We should I bring an innocent life into the world knowing that she's not going to have a father how she grew up without a father. Just comments that you have and they can keep your comments to himself."
"I guess in the journey. What were the most liked that woman moment? That you guys remember? We were really overwhelmed with a lot from people that are trying to show off at daycare and they are supportive about what was Grandma Brothers, kids, some food for us and sent it down to us. Even though this our extended family members and bring it over to a book on Simon. We know that if someone gets bigger and bigger and there's no answer to it, that people will start to talk correctly. So we did everything as what we did, our birth announcement."
"If you and stuff like that and where we are now store named write, my extended family members also make customized gift for her. Even though they were finding something for her, like, our clients and Friends, our close friends or people that we have lost contact with extended family members that receive. Probably once a year preparing stuff like that for a while. We had her first month celebration and he was doing my makeup. So people will show you guys about like our society in general because I mean,"
"Existing existing laws and marginalizing, general community, and support in general, tso's and Ice around in circles, right? How do you feel about it and doze off like we playing three times a day and all is still a long road, but for now, we are questionable. We should. I maybe you should like, as long as Singapore can become more inclusive, the legal part of it is something to be done, but it doesn't have to be something that we are focusing on it. Rushed into all the time. If people that we meet on the streets, can be more supportive and not no morning to see if I rather just keep the comments that, so them self. That's good enough for us for now. Call me hope that before I pass on to her, but if it cannot be done, then I just have to deal with it because"
"I'll be denial our rights as a parent, but we are just prepared for it. You have anything to say, back to the same sex parent with a child to become a society. So that the kids will be able to grow up happy and healthy. And also don't don't change that much discrimination because we just know that feeling of just being there and we just hope that this can translate to the rest of everyday life. Want to try for kids. They can also come and speak to us so we can share them."

We are in our work from home, a tire pajamas, after this three-part, work-from-home special, we can meet each other day. We can meet the crew again and things. Can go back to a little secret that they don't know. If that sometimes we wake up like this and we also go to the city like this."
"What is everyone up to us that we still get to go into work every single day and we got a routine and stuff like that. It's just that we spend more time at home, eating with family, which is not that thing. Correct. I agree that I think like I also consider myself very lucky to be able to still step out the house. Even if it's just you do homework what home? But at least you saw him get to step out for a bit and breathe in some fresh air, right? This is a media copy of the new matches across different stations for 60 precautionary measures. We are not allowed to like each other so I haven't seen like Jemaine and as we were in real life for the longest time, I don't think we have ever not meant for such a long period of time because I felt sort of like"
"Little bit so I can you do know that actually we meet every day. Every single day. That's right. We buy dinner together and office and we just chill together, eat together and we haven't been able to do that for some time. But you know, how has this new face to heightened alert affect that. You girls in terms of like, I don't know, work your social life, your personal life, but I think in general, you know, the whole pandemic really changed the way that we we work at 3 to DJ's, we always have to, you know, do interviews and stuff like that. In the past. We could never do it. If that's a if they're not traveling to Singapore or it's only on my phone, but now we get to see them face-to-face on video call, which I think it's really a blessing to all of us and and it's something that hopefully will continue even after this, right. I have a, I have a confession to make and I make a confession."

Address everybody.
Go to do YouTube to check out a zero without a donut.
Bring a brown out.
"Massage, well, I do like you don't say it's a bit easier than circuit breaker in my personal opinion because back in a 2020, doing the circuit breaker X I think was a bit harder to, even that go out and get things done. But at least now we can still go out to people. And I can see when I go running with a friend at this and I think since the beginning of this entire pandemic to working from home and you know what the things that we love about wfh, but they are also things that we don't like as much. So that goes what?"
"I feel like in the last year or so cuz we have virtual meetings without whole like, you know, a station, right at the start. I cared about what I look like by now. I truly don't care. I am in the meeting with this. The bank's role on my head. I'm going to wash my face and they're so used to it, watching me. Do my whole face makeup routine. So I think I feel like it makes us closer and said, cuz we see each other in home setting, nice."
"We can take things at home. You know, you don't have to get ready for it. Sometimes I said."
"One more confession, right? I had another meeting at the same time. So I was on too many things. At the same time with my camera on, you should not your boss listening."
"That's why I listened to both meetings. So it's okay. I was a tentative multitasking at its best every Wednesday morning, so that we have our, yes, you since I'm family meetings and they usually start at 11 p.m. 11 a.m. So, I will always set my alarm at 10:58. So that gives me 1 M news. And at 10:59 because I don't want to be late. I will enter the stream and I'll be early and I'll get my brightest. And then I will turn off my video camera. And my mic is well."
"The best work from home has given us. These are what we love about working from home. But are there any bet working habits that you guys picked up? Because of the pandemic, be honest be honest. I don't do people laugh."
"Maybe after this baby of this, everybody would try and put it in the view with me angry that they write. I was on a meeting. Okay, you're angry, angry, angry, angry, but very angry. I was on a month thing and I was honking during this time. He came out of the bathroom and he shalt it Messier."
Introduce myself.
"He didn't know, he didn't know, he didn't know. I was speaking."
"What does it mean? If you like, Emma Stone?"
"But yeah, things like that happen. So this is what I hate about working from home because, you know, life gets in the way. Sometimes that stuff like, you know, people going off to do things in the middle of the day. Because now they're working from home yet. I never. I never, I don't block every day. I come to the studio on time or early in the morning shower like a warm nice shower. It's like this entire work from home situation happen, right? I don't take my money showers anymore. Rose by. Before I go all the way to like evening time, right? Before I go into the shower."
"And my old freak, I stink."
"Quiet ones in the day once at night. Oh my God, Jimmy."
It is in the morning or night night morning because I need to be clean before I go out.
Hey.
Make a note that we both wake up.
"You know what remind me of this thing's knows 1D. Make a couple of months ago. That was on the way home in the car. And it so happened that John. Okay, love songs, love stories. Yes. Woman who wrote to him and also help during the CB that was when she and her partner who is not Singaporean had to spend all the time in the house together, right? And that was also the time that she discovered that he went for days without showering."
Do you know one what what do you mean she discovered by Four Seasons at kind and you know how little of them there in Winter? They just don't shower schedule. A wake up. Wake up. Wake up in Singapore. Would you guys not shower for like two days in a row?
"It's, I think it's not in Windows."
Really? You mean like if I don't sweat? I'm okay. If I'm like in B all day and I really can't imagine snowstorm you can head out right now.
"But of course in Singapore, it's so hot here. Okay. So this brings us to my next question. What are some things that you have hurt your friends? Do that? They know they should not be doing while working from home. I have so many stories and Nick's room."
"Okay, so she starts work at 9 a.m. Write every morning, but for some reason she had this bad habit of overworking the previous night. So I'm sure you and that say like, 9 p.m. When she supposed to end at like 6 p.m. Just so she can sleep in the next morning, so she doesn't have to start work at 9 a.m. Instead. She can start at like, 6:11 a.m. To every morning when I wake up and go get my day started and he's already got 10 flaws in the morning and she still sleeping and I'm like, dude. I'm just supposed to go on at 9 a.m. But she just texted me."
My bugga what you want. Don't say anything.
"No, it was a compliment. My sister. She will wake up. She would turn on the computer and then she would go back in on the news for a bit. But of course, she makes sure that the job is done. You don't like, oh, my God and accounting. I don't know. But it's so unnecessary, show the whole world that you're online on your team, know your Google meeting, or whatever it is that you are there available. And then nothing will happen. Song Tik Tok. So a lot of companies using Microsoft keeps right on and you have to show your boss that you're online. If you don't move anything on your laptop and your idol, you're away from keyboard JFK, then it becomes a Wii."
"You get. Hi. Yeah, it's all because of that, someone on Tik Tok actually hooked up their mouth to their bed. And then, as the fan moves, the mouse moves."
What is the cause of always move? So you always be available? You always be online.
"Oh my God, you know what? Some of our Clarity full of wasn't Instagram? Also gave us a few highs and I thought this was brilliant. Okay. This person call my cell phone teens. So my status is placed in a call and nobody will disturb me."
Genius. You think like bosses will come and teach my employees.
"Life hacks with sharing. Okay, as long as you get your stuff done, I would you like to actually like she professes sale in so we can talk to you no working from home as well. Is that you're expected to be available at all times. Even if it's an evening or even you do on your lunch break because you're working harder than any company employs a lunch break away from work. Do you guys find yourself napping a bit more doing work from home? But it's taking a little time out for yourself. Nothing. But maybe like I wake up slightly later."
"I know, I know if people that will like squeeze in a power nap when they're working from home in the middle of the day. I think it's completely fine. Honestly, if I ever run a company like sleeping pods for people to think I'm going it. I think it helps productivity and I will bring the path of walks in like work-from-home lunch, bring up by lines and, you know, bring the doggy go. I want you no more time to bond with loved ones, in the family, but sometimes are some employees. I do anything for granted and the abuse b, a b, a b, a b like taking longer than an hour for lunch break. Go for like a two and a half hours break, and just tell your cousin to the fan on team. I think these things happen as well."
"Confess to a straight. One of them, isn't it? Is decent. I'm going to see the bean cuz she'll get in trouble. If I had a beer with a friend while on a zoom call that we both needed to it then see, I love beer. I think it's fine. You know that girl, but kind of meat of a day. It if you need like a bad. Try to get you going. I think she is. Okay. What do you think?"
"I think the bosses would not be happy to hear about it either way. And well, she's mocking her students papers, right, she drinks. So I put it says that she swears this teacher is very, very responsible. But sometimes the stress gets a bit too much for her and this is where you just need to be appreciate them all but I was about to drop in the gentle note that excessive drinking is really really bad for health. So we really need to work because you don't make me angry. Okay? Being in a meeting and accidentally unmuting myself meeting fucking shit about the people in the meeting."
"I don't badmouth anyone in the meeting typing scary scary and is on and you just, you just roll your eyes."
"I'll take pictures of my colleagues faces and it sent it to them on WhatsApp, but why? So angry?"
Best buddies. You guys do have your cameras on like you're supposed to do on your camera.
"Oh, your boss. When is the truth about what you think of it? To be honest? I feel that it's not always necessary. But I mean they do say live in. If you are you do not listen right now. You're not dressed up something like that. That's fine. But for the most part, you know, they will just not to like hey, you know, your price if you watch recipes on your cameras on due to see that, but I have to see on the cameras. Really does make the entire meeting a lot more productive, you know, just so you are always on a lot more. You don't want your boss to catch you. I still need. So you always put in your fullest attention. I find it when it's one of my camera. Sometimes I I just don't know if it. I just told you I'm listening to now or when we was celebrated Hazel's birthday before this entire thing."
Weren't you on a meeting? During that? Buffet lunch? Sorry.
And good lunch with a good one and a half hours in 2 hours.
"Going to do with having lunch and I had a meeting that the jamming to. So, at some point. I feel like everybody had heard bits and pieces of a meeting and let me know if we were in the actual restaurant. We would like a cafe. But the Rockets do, you know, listen to a meeting and get things done. So this is what I guess I'll get moving on. I would like to know share some of the concessions from our fellow followers on our calamities Instagram platform. So some of the conversations that you guys have have done all that you have made. Okay. I see one for the take her breakfast or lunch and then go for a nap at 1. This that's not. So I work from home."

I'm just rambling on to myself. I just passed away. I'm going to go walk.
"Way to go to get your thoughts on the waiting list every tiny little thing that I had to do, even if it's just so, you know, just got to write it down when I play a game of Rummy his scouting and of course, retail therapy, you know, what does make you feel healthier research has shown, a lot of psychological and therapeutic value when you are shopping.

"I'm serious, but I think it's in those know that I strongly believe in being friends of my ex's, the non-toxic ones. I'm looking to go to do exercise, then we can keep in contact with you on good terms, that to me, but before cuz I know my girls don't really get in contact with the exes in my right. If I'm dating my ex now. Does that count? All right. Okay, but yeah, okay. I can respect that. You guys can stay friends with your exes, right? Yeah, we know that I I didn't really commit before they is so share more later. I think I did. All right, and it's time for our one and only"
Male opinion today Marcus. What about you? What about me?
"I think I think I lean more towards like my first experience is that I think the more towards Jemaine and the conditions of La conditions, but like how, how, to breakup was initiated. Also, like you mentioned this idea of like if he was toxic, you know, what you will not want to light switch. With the, I think a certain question. What is one song that comes to your mind songs? That first comes to mind. Is this song by Rachael Yamagata, I wish you love."
I wish you Shelter From The Storm a cozy fire.
"But most of all when snowflakes fall, I wish you love kissing you all the good thing that I have tried. Like at the point of breakup do usually say, you don't let's be friends. You know, let's try and then let's not lose contact with each other but it never works out for me, but you just dies out that Walt and yeah, I think a lot of complicated factors but also the fact that we was so co-dependent during our relationship. You have to have that clean break."
"You always be in each other's lives. You can't grow from there. That does my own personal experience. When you say, oh no my friend right now. I broke up with the first time around. He was like, can we stay friends with benefits?"
I want to have sex with me.
Joe keery.
"He's a good guy. But you know what? Some people say that The Break-Up can be worse than bereavement when someone dies that gone forever. But if you're experiencing a break up the still alive when they leave, right? And sometimes all the way, you look at the Instagram to Facebook with the photos and videos and see them having fun. You feel even more pain, Why do you choose not to stay friends with your ex Marcus? What do you think? Cuz you're on the I don't say France in my ex speech. So I feel ya. I also I think I hope to remain friends by no days will be difficult because I think it's going to be a bit awkward between us because I saw you the kind we see let's pick up but can we still remain friends with benefits?"
"In my experience, I guess I like a real party is being more than I am. Not. So I think I didn't use that for that. Okay? Okay, okay friends, and maybe for like the cup of Life first. Few weeks that kind of stuff. Can you can still talk to me for like like for her? She she would choose the distance, you know, that love is never even trade. That's always going to be a mismatch are in balance of like coolest, Galveston Mall."
"Adida pants, but I think in the case of like, let's say it was Mutual, then I think that should be different. Also, both parties agree that let it go is the way to go to the song before we even get there at this point in my life. But I feel like we were friends before we will love us. So it's invisible. He's a huge. Huge part is because, you know, the date, when does a point to decide where they get together or it's like totally out, right? So I think that case right now that the choice to stay friends is another choice. So maybe you'd want to put yourself through that, that that, that, that we experienced. No."
"We like it. When people are friends, that I says that when he tells me like, oh she"
"I think that's why I was so nice life had become quite in the point that you so much family that the community is like chat and check on me. Like that is all you do. And I always believe that you can stay friends. But until I can look at you and feel nothing, that's where we'll be friends and ship. That might be hurt. That might be residual. Feelings is Right, tough luck because I feel like I didn't do right at some point in your life. They've been all that you wanted. Do you really have to do, you know, remove it or even if you don't stay friends, do you really have to laugh like me, be ill feelings upon knowing that I'm still friends with Jordan, right? A lot of my friends to ask me like a, what are you?"
"Think about this. Do you think that's any chance of you and him getting back together? I get these questions like all the time and I can very honestly tell them, you know, I don't deny that there is a possibility of us getting back together. Next time. If we mean to we, it has been since we had broken up which means nothing has progressed, right? Which means you cannot get back together because everything was a repeat of things change. I don't deny that is a possibility. But for now, I think in a very happy place in focusing on myself by Korea and I have gotten to talk to. His family is always backing me up, and that's very, very nice."
"I mean, between a soft spot, wanna is a fight to do, you know, we were in school and all that, but I think in the fall you break, we did remain friends. Ishlah. He's very emotionally mature, like no matter what, what he doesn't think that way with him, and that's what's great about him. And it's only other access. I would never friends with them before we put it to a question. I don't think you can remain friends with exes that I'm just no good at all. I have a question though. I think like a course at a point of view. And what was your see you you once they are no feelings. It's on your shirt."
"My friends love. But like what is like, what if someone goes to Nick Rich or if you feel like you want to start dating? Someone else that what happens when you change for you guys if you find someone else? Okay, and everything is good, but he has an issue with you being friends with Jordan. I want a disposition know because it goes to show that we don't think the same way as a matter of whether he likes me because he doesn't trust me. He doesn't trust the choices that make and that goes to show that I cannot be this person for the rest of my life in France by thing. When they say I start dating someone else as respect to my partner like I would choose to stay awake."
"4 M compared against like the accident and it's so involved in my life. I think she was so compared against like you know that we've had so many stories of Leo, you know, the guy is super close with his ex still have nothing to worry about you even like for female friends. So, I think it's like that sometimes also show that this person is a keeper. If he or she goes back to ask before you you know, you just got to realize earlier that you should be moving on. It's not like you don't meet one-on-one. Maybe is that you you make me a community like to play in a girlfriend."
"For the greater good, right? I think that's a bit more palatable for, like, like the new partner is a little question that he started out in three, two, one. Is it cool to suggest friendship during a breakup? For example, I hope we can still be friends. Let's be friends. OK, and 3."
We are you feeling.
I think at that point of time maybe it was funny is distance and time to to to the apartment to kill. So I think to suggest that is is more of a formality.
"I just think that it is a very natural thing to say on the planet break up because it's like a transition. What is that? When you quit smoking, you don't quit cold turkey, right? When you break up, you know, you have to have that may be 12 weeks. Like, how are you? Okay. Okay. Thanks going. Just so that the other person knows. So it's not out of my life. You're okay. If your heart breaking, I feel like you should so much of your life. It does not have to be that way. You know, where you remove yourselves from each other's life. For me. I definitely feel that is not cruel because I would do my part to make sure that I still check in with other person. Yeah, I still find out like"
"He's doing and stuff like that. But I do agree know sometimes as the years pass by and things just like Fade Out. It's okay. Just let it reacts with natural process right now at the kindness of gave it suggests an attachment to respect that transcends. The circumstances of the Romantic relationship for example, but it can also be seen this crew and we understand, even though we don't think that it is but some people feel like, you know, it's you just think stuff to Summit Brewery the feelings of anger of hurt and in other pressure in your relationship was really toxic and co-dependent. Maybe like your ex was the one who perpetuate the dead, they want to be friends with you is like holding you, right? In every situation reasons why people actually stay friends with the accident would like to share of a hush. Listen to. Yeah. I think one of them is for civility, they want to break up to kind of Hut less than it would, you know, rather than you"
"I think we've mentioned that as well. They also say that, you know, it's for reasons relating to unresolved romantic desire."
"Lamarcus mention want to make things less awkward between the friends, you know, especially if you hang out in the cleat in the community, you don't want to just destroy the Friendship because of the both of you, this person was maybe like your protector, your world, you're everything for so many years. You kind of still want that security blanket around me for awhile. This reminds me of a line from an Adele song. Never mind. It is my heart. Tell me, who do I run to"
"That is very true. I think at the point of a break up. That's how many people feel you, feel scared. You feel alone. What do I want? You mentioned actually ties in with this author of hot to do with a surprising feminist issue of breaking up, a name is Kelly. She actually said that the popularity of thing, friends are attempting to stay friends after break-up may be tied to the right in loneliness than ever. I think about that broke up during the pandemic. Are you guys holding up? Okay. Okay. You can buy your feelings. I have a question for Hazy. But that line said that easy to be blood off of your breakup with Jordan. Did you guys ever say it and get it?"
"No, okay, we need. It was a very healthy breakup. Music holding, releases, it full of a healthy wake up. And even though I've been to this place had dinner with parents with even being in the same room and I respect him for that. Respect myself with it as well. I love that. Maybe it's a little bit different because this one is about a divorce. Okay, so maybe it's a bit more that's more to it. Right? But I have a friend who has a many many years of being together and honestly, right. Better friends now than they ever were. Like their relationship Now is better than it has ever been text all the time. They are both dating other people. It's amazing and I'm like, wow, but it's definitely healthy right? Healthy healthy. They don't cross the boundary."
"Anything but it's just like chat with each other like friends or maybe they just weren't compatible as a couple as friends, it works. And so can I just ask Marcus a question? How long ago was the last break up? If you don't mind answering me properly? It's been 16 years."
5 years old was that relationship and how do you do with it? So I think I felt when the next one. You're so important thing to do for for both of us to spend the rest of my life with and then I
"It was not yes or no, but it was a hesitation. So I think like Mondays. I think it was like to be teased like Christmas or Chinese New Year within the first month or two. So because she held on to some things that you want to ask me back like you had to return to me. So when that happened on so I could see like there was still some of those are the most painful thing of a break up my spazio dragons, please."
"Yeah, okay. Okay. So this is how you feel with your break up. I felt like, maybe I I could be friends, but maybe for her, she felt like can be friends probably."
"You say what? I'm feeling from a breakup. Okay. Confession. I've never been broken up with me for about 10 years has the longest. I've been single is 3 months and that was before I started eating a surfer to okay, in that period of time. I was alone on my exchange. I was single. I was alone at the time of my life, right off, my own insecurities with myself cuz there's no one to projected onto during those few months. I feel, I really have to understand myself before, you know, I came back to hit me up. Then the next thing, you know, we are getting married."
"Four years later, but, yeah, I think it was a great importance in three months on me, by people of different. That's like an habit met up with him, your boo-boo. He was saying that, you know, he really misses me, no matter who she said that they don't come close to me."
"How do I get to see it? I want to watch little things that show, you know, if I travel by myself, so, I will walk around like, the whole city 4 hours, and just think about my life. It was like, a bit depressing, but it's something that I needed as well, cuz I've been in a relationship for so many years and never got that chance. Do you know, face myself and just be with your selfie? I don't understand the hood that I projected on the other. People don't care about you. I mean, even though you were in that committed before, but did you feel the hurt of getting out of"

But a lot of things are still happening in my life. Now, the good things. I know. Okay. So this guy that you are talking about, right? The one that you want things from you guys, classify it as a relationship or the exclusive dating or I don't classify a relationship only because I feel like when you walk into it and know that nothing's going to come out of it. It was a very"
"I mean, my CPS, right?"
"What is a very like you already know nothing's going to come of it, but you know what, like, let's share this time, I guess and Let It Go a bit longer than it should be. Okay. And then a bit more feelings. So involved that I should be, as well. He's like a young kind of YOLO woman's, okay. Okay, but I'm happy that you've gotten out of it. And yes, Gruen.

"I remember I was just like looking I was running late. So I was looking up at the sky and I was wondering how she was doing and how she is, and I thought that. Okay. Maybe she's under the same blue Scylla and also look like with the sky. Also brings love hope and off like a change. So I thought I'd okay. You know what?

"Open you. The thing that he said that my U City quotes on Instagram stories. Be part of your life. So I'm just going through a rough patch of breakup. I would want to Avail myself. You do Mall, 22, the bus cuz I know that. But so if you'll only what you said, so I don't want them to be, you know, what to think or behave distractedly. So I didn't have any close friends and I'm going through a close friends that when you need them the most or pick up."
"Like a new hobby or spot that you really want to do for a long time. Now, I think that all these are like me practical things that you could do, but it doesn't erase it. So like that.... We always yeah. Just just just just isn't it for maybe I'll try to look at the relationship to actively which I think you are very very well for the breakup on yourself. All I drink them all day. Probably isn't going to help much. I think things happen for a reason. People come into your life, for specific reasons and they leave or go reason as well. Yeah. So this next question is going to be tough to answer. Shoot shoot. You be friends with your ex 1 2 3, okay."
"21 Knoll way to tell you yesterday, because only the relationship was healthy and keep on your life as a friend. I think. Definitely know why not. Yeah, Nancy no-cost. Like, I think it was more. Like, if I were to be too close to my ex that say, I start dating someone, I don't know. Immediately, like to switch out, like, just there and then that you would take me some time to do this. Then send it to you. Like, I, I, I would Li"
"Are you as well? Yes, I guess, I think if your friends, your friends, if you're not, you're not, but I think at the end of the day, you going to find a cell phone. I think when it comes to stay in front of your ex for me, even if it's just a friend or a relationship or anything. Like I really believe in cutting off. Toxic people that didn't serve you and growing from that. Unfortunately. Most of my relationships haven't got them off like and follow them. Blocked them. Even just remove them completely for my life. And I feel like I can move on with my life boss, didn't we? But I supposed to know you just formula cause you to be who you are today. A very kind and genuine person. And I think maybe two and maybe do you. I think you know, I also contributed to the toxic relationship. I Am Not Innocent here as well. But because I was able to cut them off and not continually beating that site."
"Talking to them and all that I could just Grill from that, right? Should I do you do, how you, how you going to work from from that? You know, I have you gotten to see. I don't want to behave that way and then you move over here so that you should unfollow and unfriend that person for a while. If it takes you some time to decide whether you want to be friends with this person, at least for the first few months after the breakup on solo first. So that you don't see him in your life. You don't know your thoughts in space of yourself. I mentioned sell focus of kids are very important for sure. They don't know that yet."
"Important for couples to and Friends of a healthy boundary could look like something like that. Don't talk everyday, but let's check in with each other every now and then when I first broke up with me, so if I feel like my mother didn't know about Dury's she was texting him behind my back every day. While I was a chance to someone, who knows, you know, and they would text back and forth for like just knew your know that I didn't know. I feel like he would tell me how you see. Yeah, I think I mean, you couldn't control it."
"Two days ago Instagram, OK Google, 10 and they can accept it. That you're friends with Jordan, but that you are very friendly with his parents and make them insecure. Then I would see what Jordan Space because I think it's ultimately, his call. If he's like me, he thinks that then that person is in a keeper, right then? No problem. But if he feels like he can take a step back. I definitely would want to say that for sure for sure if his future girlfriend, but also in a situation where that say you have kids together excess with kids together. I think cool parenting such a huge thing these days and I have a better relationship than"
"Yeah, before we can talk about building trust in the new relationship after the breakup. It is very, very important. So, another question is it, a flight for new relationship? If someone is friends with their EX,"
"So, you're about to be in a new relationship with someone, but that person friends at xcaret is a red flag. Yes, okay. For you. People the benefit of the doubt, you know, you never wanted to cause judgment if you don't know what their situation is. No D. No. It's even as in a rather good sign that this person is just no emotionally mature. They're not pasty, and they can see past the stuff that broke them up. So I will know that this person is able to see the good in things. I didn't know cuz I think that is very it's like something that is a deal-breaker can reflect something that is like really, really cannot accept like"
"Like, I don't know why they are so, so it's a bit. So I think like, is there something that I will talk to you something but it's not like funk you up cuz I think we are all emotional beings. Know. We, we have feelings and you're right. Like, if the person has that you say something about them as well, and like to think of it positively the rear light, then you know that a person is the person really loves then, they will be very yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that doesn't break up. You know. All right, before we end of this episode, any last words of advice all this in this out there."
"What is France and not? I think it's up to you guys to decide, you know, as we have discussed. Is there so many factors. So I think work it out between within yourself and also between your partner and then discuss. What is something that you think would be would be best left. So I just want a relationship, Keith gross self love, and gratitude. I think this is very very important and I hope all your business. How they can keep this in mind that, you know, you are your own kings and queens. And you should definitely always put yourself. Absolutely. I think going through a break-up, you may feel like, you know, was I not enough that I don't do enough, but always just validate your own feelings about it. You are worthy and you deserve love. No matter."
"Happened reminds me of a proof that I really, really, really like. So I'm going to read you the entire think it's quite long. But basically, it says that when someone comes into your life, sometimes it's like an angel being sent out of a Halo to save you and the time you need it to give you something at the time that you need, and you have to be careful because sometimes that angel is not yours to keep that. When the time is up, that when he has sucked, his Papa's that he will be removed. This is very nice. And I also, you know, it sounds like please in line with seeing the good, right? And knowing that everybody has its public your life, no for seasonal reason, but as in, we are angels forever, forever forever."
"I'm going keep going man. Enjoy his season and I think that at the end of the day, if you're going through a break-up and let's say you don't want to be friends. But I think you should remember that if that person needs you as a point, maybe for a while just to type them through we do. Maybe you were really all that. They had. Yeah, just try and maybe be there for each other and know that you ended the relationship ship together your existing it together as well. Right? And you can still be there for each other just as conditioner. I agree. You know, what's another good way to heal from a breakup listening to good music. So Marcus talk about your breakup song, the concept of it in English is good for you, I can. So it's a it's a it's a 3 chapter story of a different parts of a of a"

"Very touch base at this time. So you Matilda I think, you know being launched into space off of Instagram to Thornton on YouTube you get a fair amount of comments in"
"You don't they go from very minimal ones like using words, like f a t Phat from saying like, oh, you so different from 5 years ago, on my bestie. This look at it. He can do things happen very often. But of course, there's like a spectrum, right? We look at, look at the ones that accused me of like, having a medical thyroid, you know, even personally attacking my relationships. You know, what, you want me to go by my parents day, things like that. I'm so sorry."
"Sorry, I was so angry. When I guess it's Target that to just making me feel ashamed, you know, so it could be he just got done. What's like? I saw you all like you're such a smile. You are like a whole, you are very deep. Then it can be at the intersection of Eddy will reach out to my clients. The people that I know that I want with my family, just to see if I owe how you friends help out how you like them? Okay? With how she's like as a person. And I guess across the u.s. It does hunt by thing with good support. You know, you really like you feel better. Thank you. Mother father."
"How is on for remind me and Girl doll? Just like this is happening. And then time on the sea, in Netflix, take it down from there, that there was a sharing like photos for my Instagram book, about my weight, and how I change within the past five years. And then you do speculating, like different things that will offer. What's being said, really funny like terms like stinky boo, or do you know? Boo."
"Because I'm always afraid of letting see, the foldings to spend time doing my office hours, you know, considering looking through scrolling, through this comment, didn't sit right with me and don't see nothing on the go to take it down. And see that, you know, there was cleared Oxon Hill, you know, things like my old house and my parents place. They're going to take him to my parents occupations as well, sit, right. At that point. I felt too invasive."
"Thought it was small enough to be alive. She did yet, you know, I think that's the most extreme. There was so many different like night here at the bar light. All you know, I think she should kill herself. Maybe you can for a few days and didn't really feel that great. But now I'm giving day so many years ago. I think the best thing that I said was that you need to not be on the phone. So just, you know, spend time with family, try your best to detach yourself. And I think that really greatly helped my mental health, and the moral replay across the yard and you will never stop."
"Yeah, and I I Stanley us, if you know anybody who sings that comment, you just called them out because it's not kind. You know, I hate when you see on Instagram. I just saw it on Instagram. Off me about what someone else and I just felt this like, like stinging. My heart is not nice. I why would you say things like that to someone who's already going through something that you know, really just went to lunch ready. Myself at that point. I was thinking like, oh my God is say read something wrong with me. So I thought it look into it because you can't see things that I don't know myself. So right after that, I think I should try to get myself checked out and I don't feel I hate or something or if everything's okay."
"Is she such a huge Centre woman? Right? She said that she might amuse. It also that, you know, my voice is what matters, how I react and he'll respond to it is what matters to identify this is doing this, so I guess"
"I think for four rooms, like they actually back later in the week. So if you have proof of it, always just right into the at 9, to take it down. And usually, they will take it down unless you find is no harassment and they won't take it down. And I usually won't pursue most of them block, and delete is like, my favorite two things to do. If you're not giving me feedback days, you know contractive. I'm not listening to you. If you're just going to come in, on my parents, will I also know that I am already aware of, so, it doesn't help me to grow my own development and to be a better for you.

You know, you said? Okay. I'm going to improve myself and that's what people actually follow as well. Follow your entire Johnny, you know, they grew up with you, your followers go up with you, you know, the struggle along that you alone.

"Today, I'm here to show you some self-defense techniques to protect yourself against sexual harassment cuz remember sexual harassment can happen anytime. Anyway, all right. Oh my God, you know what? I mean?"
Let me show you how to do it.
"Hi, I'm shy with China and I like to wish all of you, a very happy International women's day this year in conjunction of international women's day. And we want to introduce some self-defense tips to you. Why am I talking about self defense? It's where people should be educated. But I think it's going to take some time to educate the population about sexual harassment. Going to go for self-defense, tips. First. I have MMA fighter. Tiffany Co also known as no chill. Just let my fight but I know you'll teach self-defense techniques as well. I like to ask you what are the common scenarios where you know people get harassed. Yeah, I guess I sound like a nice. Even though. I'm a terrible sometimes, you know, when I walk home alone at night."
"Witness says, I should be able to do this, right? Okay, so I've been going through some different scenarios that, you know, people find themselves in trouble standing position sitting down. I know. So I guess in the line position, nothing most ladies and men. And if you kind of vulnerable in that position,"
"You can also follow the self-defense move violence to be the last resort. These kids are only to help you if you are in time of Crisis, so, my tokens are potatoes, right? Of course, for his identity with covered his face. So all the people online. Cannot make fun of standing to know, someone tries to grab you from behind the first thing, you want to attend the risk cuz it's the weakest point. You could still go at the farm. But it's kind of hard to hear. You need more effort point of least resistance will be so to attacking one. Hen two, just going to straighten. So, from here, this town is too holding on to the wrist, the other hand, you going to come and make sure that this has been a 90° to the mission log from here. All right. So you going to suck around bring the person's time all the way up to it. That the attacker do feel a bit of a pain in the ass."
"In case we want to just run away and we could also do, you could just disengage to you straighter than any? We feel like you want to go away, just create distance. This is like a frame to prevent them, but she has a temporary position. They can get help."
"Is there is someone who's Rika or smaller? And what are the moves? Can you do the same thing over here after I bring the grip? So this late. I'm going to stop it right behind his time. I wanted to be deep over here or I cost you anything off your boss, you're tripping him over a box if it's not enough. Nothing tripping, his legs. So, the upper hand behind."
"Wow, when someone gets sexually harassed the first question people ask them was what were you wearing? You wearing anything and still get sexually harassed and you could be wearing anything and still defend yourself. We're going to do some moves to the sitting position where the person is fighting restricted and say, you know someone touches yes, I would you do force of all the same thing attacking at the weakest point, but just do the wrist. Okay? All right. So from here, you going to come under the wrist? Okay, you just going to punch it up. The what if someone puts their hand over your shoulder and keeps the death by natural reaction, is to use that I can hold onto the reservation, remove the threat, bring it over."
"And then call for help. I'm back with a code scenario. This time. I want to know when a victim is attacked in a pot or an isolated area where the perpetrator jumps out of nowhere, pushes the victim on the floor in a position where they're right on top of them. How can we protect themselves? Some simple moves that you can do to off-balance the attacker of your body of balance in the mount position to his pandering, right? So I'm going to control only one if I control this and I'm going to bring him to the site. If I'm controlling the song. I'm going to send some follow that his elbow. So I'm going to the beach."
I can stand back up and run away all and kick him in the groin.
"Turn off of the second move and we can use if someone is in a different position. So now he's in between my legs, if it's finding me. I'm going to have both of his hips. What is base. All right. This is going to come up step back into a standing position."
"Okay, of course, when you struggle will have to be comfortable with your outfits, the top you're wearing. It'll be all over the place. But I guess that, the first thing you do is protect yourself and getting out of the day getting out of this. Thank you. So after running through all the different, you know, Sienna Rose and techniques. So you have any questions and you can use to find as difficult. I found the ones they were sitting right next to me and they have my size. So, you know, just just grab the wrist or even the one that they grabbed me from the back. I think it's generally easy to do. Of course, they require strength and you need to get over the brain freeze moment and it sits on how someone can actually get over there and I guess to get over it. I say the first one is practicing, the move regularly. Anything you learn self-defense, running writing or reading anything, you have to practice makes perfect. The way. I feel like the way we breathe effects of heart rate and interns affect how we react. So, if you can control your breathing, you can come yourself."
"Little bit more and hopefully make a better decision from that defends workshop for ladies for kids everyone. So, I hope you learned something from this video and you can share it and try it and, you know, join classes and also educate everybody about taking them self again. It doesn't matter what you're wearing, you know, people get abused in any scenario. So it's very important to know that it's not the victims fault. I hope you share this video with all your friends and I mean, no chill, no chill right now."

when I was young I always felt like skinny is a feeling you know you can feel skinny because your stomach is empty the emerging just feel better about yourself and that was ingrained in me and I think I did almost anything and everything to fit into society standards and that's another thing right the issue of thinking that the way you look it close to how you should feel when you're growing thinking into that mindset when you grow up you still going to have that people around you have also put that in mind that in the present to you like how you look because to how much you're worth how you look it goes to how beautiful you are without putting any effort into who you are as a person like there's more to how I am based on how I look so many things that I love them all messed up and it's 90% of it is not even about my body is about who I am as a person trying to love my body properly having piss myself I would say maybe this year or even last year where I'm kind of install advocating for body positivity because it became talk
play positivity like trying to put yourself into this box of like I love myself and I should pressure myself to love myself because it's me I got so tired of thinking that 90% of the time I'm going to do that nobody's ever going to do that you know and when I heard about the body neutrality I felt like this is so liberating because you just have to just let it be because your body is the least interesting thing about you
hi welcome back to something private since it's a special episode by the music right
you know the guy didn't find one of my old G hair removal policy Tampa strip
they have another brand called tulips and invited us to join them on Sunday to Mission can you guys about stuff that's right I'm talking about talk about it was so cute all the time but she is a big part in our overall health and well-being so how do we get a little bit in a five-part miniseries every last Wednesday of the month
Angela l o s s on the episode Mickey Mouse most popular episode today I guess masturbation really hit a highlight of negativity in the 1700 where was the site of disease is still in there so if I would be interested in I do see patients on a regular basis and on top of that I'm training sexual medicine relationship issues and I see you let you know I need
either find someone who is going to help my pictures of my clients a bigger issues or I go to cycle six years ago there was very little help a little professional help and that was well and that was when I ended up in Europe to get myself that if is one of their fellows and the European sexual medicine Society The Family Doctor Who has a special interest in medicine and it would help you out in Lihue
me to be a way of life my female pass down there I feel like I don't know I was thinking about my private life and it wasn't he the first ever maybe I had a flight with our parents shower asking the kids I don't think they grown labeling different body parts let me wash the Volvo dealership in yeah and then I guess I'm the kind of sense of Shame
as something like we should have you mentioned I guess I'm Fallout 4 girls while I go see flight both of us
like the vagina inside outside but when you are young I mean just thinking about it like when I was a child you were told you like but they didn't you message me and hiding it with speaking and say you know her forehead
I need like boys and girls he doesn't identify involve us and that's exactly the same thing that I was looking for quiet on a huge loss she was overweight and she want to lose weight I don't cuz you know because that's how to enhance loss program the psychology diet and exercise so on the condition that we had was about tell me about you and it was interesting you know how she told me that
identify the bag because I would have thought it would be like to know the waist line the type of or something right that is very sexual medicine in s i just let that go and I call you the conversation with her I realized it she has a great Challenge and embracing her old family who she as a woman has been single for a while and think about how identity as a woman was never fully embraced every
so it goes to show like you know Volva is just kind of one aspect of this whole idea but what is important is how we and we see also as a woman in this boring so sorry we're so much more than just giving birth I think like you like
I think because he's also a bit of bleach additional culture I would see and sex is something that is a big No-No until you're married so before sex was always is not for you know all these things but in the moment you sign the marriage is supposed to switch over to indoctrination you can just wipe away in a statement like that
so as I do realize that if I use with such an issue they faced some form of to be or shame and embarrassment around your private part and a condition where female version of Contrition is difficult because of the tension so this is me if you peeing on me not feel pain but I'll paint you should let you know I was thinking if you relax too much and all that I would look like if I even like when you say that
I'm going down under yeah I think a lot of them or something that light it has a smell like sour the goals in life how to make your genitals the day before which is important because we need to protect the skin layers so that you know the best you can do if there is a hole like in Odessa
in the vagina in the vagina that can you save something to smell like who are the different chemicals to do whatever and the chance of us getting
and it's interesting because of that a couple of meals you have a good number of experiences with different partners and it doesn't matter because if you're just in the movement of everything you can embrace you don't like you know this is horrible person Bill smell like it smells different than usual then I guess that you should go and see if all of us when you grow up a lot of sex education
sex all night owl buddy pass to how does light affect the way we see ourselves because you always got big penises
Disney and really big that you don't know go if you are in the right yeah I think a bit more clean P I mean they might have gone for some whitening procedures and things like that this woman may not be showing the origin of always polite especially like the inner folds of the of the Lydia I like bigger than the train is going around on Instagram
liquid movies attention and that is like the song if they call it to end my point isn't how it's really affecting my self-esteem so about how can I see Olivia late model of models
yeah it's interesting the question I have is we know that is a great chance that this is photoshopped on personalized that we need to seek validation from external source

FM immensely grateful for all the support you guys have given us and you really couldn't have come this far without you if you'd like to keep the parking at work, I'll patreon at patreon.com from its private part that patreon.com / something private part"
now back to the next one
"let me tell you, this is whatever you want anyone in particular but you know where the fact that a bunch of us with the internet and without parents guidance and I didn't know what to bring to the children you know so I think and realized"
media social media has on the image of the tribute to the coolest daddy that was based in UK they say that around 15 adults in the images are constantly worried about body image
yeah cuz I didn't you say that your daughter or your son is he or she will let you can please and you're smart you'll grow up to be in lazy and you know things like that we forgot the whole thing about parenting is a holding a bottle Society is coping with the changes but I want to see that image of a look at it and I'm like okay yes I guess I should just do it but like I personally don't feel like I don't feel like
fall off like a younger audience has been like a moving train on a tick tock where they have both of us in whatever discrimination for seeing if something is unrealistic my looks like in ya like by right like mine
"the friend what do put something on IG like so can we also see that others body images and nothing different from Material you're just a part of us and how we are we don't have to be so bothered by what people have been lying, like people like why is it that I have a camel toe"
don't worry about how they look you where is the I come from Italy was quite popular to show the Midwest okay yeah you know it doesn't just look at people who offered I'm leaving plasti yeah just like whole job was also once upon a time and it does supposed to present a variety of course for something that you don't hand us the root cause to me is more efficient to run
if someone can work with you to find out what exactly is causing the insecurity is going to be a more concerted effort getting down to what's really the heart of the. Betrayal of like it though it goes like this she's a Russian on how I view my body hair and I think it took me a long time to realize that actually the most important thing is from the group you have to go by myself
menstruation does not use a chance of getting infection so that was supposed to be here yeah so you want to be mindful that it doesn't aggravate the default in the area of area is what gives you comfortable with easier
really negative relationship with our bodies would be really challenging and you might want to seek professional help I do I'm not sure whether you guys have watched the video where a teacher can you show the effect of raising a is Golden Apple any DaVita goes like so the teacher. The whole class has good apple but he and then go to whole class to Chris and apple and then she peeled the skin of the apple and do realize that you know the one that was being scolded and not having this wedding has praised was all nice and being belittled forever he has done versus a child that was a long the way how would it be different and something I'll be for a buddy pass
close to be Josh's water park and consignee felt the shame of it and embarrassed of it you know how much negative energy I charge then recited this area and even though it's supposed to be all going to pleasure will it be able to pleasure when it comes to child receiving critical comments when they freeze ducommun will he or she be able to receive their priests brace August Optical about it is he the same as you're here so in order to fully Embrace who we are and overcome the whole gentle skin is actually a lot of internal Self book outside
I guess we didn't move away from them so how old is moving away from this and then he all right yeah I mean in the UK kids who has more for pregnancy and get it off when they have their first sexual encounter but their informed consent and if I'm understanding this kids at able to make decisions that are that we must do so it's like you know if you
little kids going to try to find a way to find out of school if you are still a virgin in University Village and let them make their own choices so it's never about protecting them from the ham is always about a endurance the tools you need to have in order to handle the challenges that the hospital is like seeing what I learned as a child from experience teach my child everything that I know but what I can't eat your apples be and Haggerty you know when things come falling down
when things are difficult when you asked you a few moments how do you have the courage to pick us up when things that I can teach her instead cuz I can foresee every situation is going to have children and what are some of the pieces of advice that you would give young people today about options to watch sex and like that so you might want to look into the wise for the wise men. You got it right now but once upon a time I'll leave you young I'll probably still less that we should expose herself so we can protect ourselves
that weasel invalid and be proud to show who you are is he so it's going to be contact so that way so as you kind of uncover I must really holding you back that is a way to start working on how can you accept yourself for who you are and it seems that the majority of men s t i c cup size boobs but
so what kind I don't think is that is so it's only way we can then we can also the law and not be skeptical when Alpine as I enjoy your voice yeah so I guess you really have to be at easy for you are to be able to take the available that we help a body parts
what's the weather for France to Heart someone who's racist comments or if someone is trying to get a date and you wanted to offer advice and become more attractive I think that the speed limit is physically go into the race
hi Hazel welcome to the loss of all three pots work from home I look at Aspen similar outfit today most competitive something that has been on all mine since covid-19 status about how the pandemic has impacted our social and mental health in the many good bad and ugly ways we're going to talk about a lot of things but before that one question for you goes every both Jimmy and what is 100%
traveling traveling with such a Escape for a lot of singaporeans and we haven't been able to do that and I meant it a trip in like fabry and back then write the viruses already around it wasn't late about it so I was like okay I'm going to get one last one out before she hit Savannah as you go I went to okay I went to find room for a music festival
how serious it was. I know because now that I think about it right except for me I'm going to say happiness in the hanging out my friends as you all extra with that kind of person I am I love spending my days outside with friends my colleague I love the human interaction and all of that away in this sense yeah I think I lose some happiness but in other ways with a penis comes back to me I have more time with family I spend more time like working out by a zoo with my friends is something new that I've never done before so I think you could be 19 we gained some weight. I think that is exactly what it is you know why it's been really tough enough people for the last year
we really want to talk about mental health and Dives deep into it what are some ways you can you know take care of yourself during this pandemic write me over the phone and we'll have to save you guys some results online on how we can better go with the ongoing pandemic and hopefully they can be beneficial for you definitely but when I asked but you know what works for us what we tried and what we think you know might help but I think if you feel like you require that bit of extra attention and help the sick advice from the professional fits right so I'm just now we mentioned some of the things that we need so far as traveling for me is the human interaction with my friends so how do you go to school with this loss okay honestly for me right I'm very much like hazel as well will always outside and for me I gain inspiration at drives me when I'm with friends you know when we we sit down for conversation is something I do a lot to do when you lost your happened and when
CB hit us right I thought that you know I was going to be okay because at the very least I was still going out to work every day while people were at home right now but actually I found it after awhile it really took a toll on me because I couldn't sit down with my friends I couldn't have the exchange of ideas and hence there was a lot of it heads up you know that was that was over and I was very honest I think he's all he really was one of them and she was so active I still remember I should continue the subscription style. Although she wasn't going out so she knows what is technically but like the fact that you could still keep going and like do stuff like that
inspiration now that you do conversations all like sitting down hanging out with off the table exactly I think sometimes you know when we think about all we can travel we can see our friends it does seem like such superficial things but this is a very serious lost right I think a professor at Monash University they did say that all these are things that we it's normal to feel sad about so validate your own feelings and don't think like I shouldn't even be feeling said about these superficial things and the other thing I feel right is that there will be some people who will invalidate your feelings and tell you like you know all these things that you are talking about they are complaining about these are privileges that some people don't even have but you know I think because we were so accustomed to it and yes or busy you know hanging out trouble and think that they are probably just as we do acknowledge that but
I think because it was a respite for his right you know it was a it was a release words right so when you take that away it becomes everybody tries to Colton that when we agree finding these like an outlet for all your negative emotions and feelings is really really helped me during the circuit breaker. I was actually more active on Tik-Tok account seems like years ago but I never put it to use it was only under the circuit breaker. S. That's cruelty to our bottom and I tell you that shit is acted so addict
it's super super episodes and videos and workout videos on Tik-Tok and you know what it actually helped me get a better kind of Regina my lifestyle and that's incredible I never thought like to talk to do this for me can you imagine going through pandemic without the internet that would be so lonely oh my goodness Heavens timer o my gosh what would he have done even like mom is like on her phone now everyday or smartphone play different games watching the news talking to a friend by WhatsApp she has so many good chance now I'm so thankful for ticked off because that is where you know during CB Hazel and I decided to do a dance together and that's how you know you said it to myself do a duet it's like that popular on Tik-Tok right we never knew you like an ad like this could help us bond together in the first place and a pandemic and remember what everybody was
find a house party mental health access to a lot of coping activities of due to their respective matches and being stuck at home in an environment like a family relationship and or abusive parents for some others they are unfortunately contributing to our emotional health and I'm talking about the negative aspect of it so some of our listeners they have actually contributed their own opinions on work from home so someone said my dad says module everyday and it's so loud
crazy being at home it truly does open you up to a lot of different things especially because we do a lot of recordings at home live stream from home they don't have Ducks Bucky my mother Shelton from outside all my good day but I can relate to this other listeners one of them actually see it stuck in the same world 24/7 what are you in the world come on
a bit like my sister or just a computer and that will and I can't even imagine you know 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily is nothing like I imagined myself with a desk job much less having to sit there in your house and I think you are dependent write something I thought about a lot worse you know were very well at the very least we were privileged that we have good homes to be in but imagine you know people who are stuck at home in environments which is not great for them if they're stuck with Papa treat this for example I think that's very very hot and I think that's also the reason why we put in many cases in the past year we've also know seems that the six of you do
the hotlines having a major increase in college I read this thing with this person said Anil Singh at home social distancing keeping yourself safe from the pandemic all these all these are Privileges and all these can only be done when you have the means for it right but people live in less than that I think that's where the challenge really comes in I think I was raised right if you're stuck in a bad situation at home maybe it's an abusive situation There Is No Escape because you're confined to your home right and I think a lot of people that work from home also find that they are expected to still work after office hours to reply to email that's right so this is when I want to share with you earlier in April which is just two months ago a study by AIA Singapore found at nine out of ten singaporeans I said that the mental health has declined in the last year and this is very scary is 90% off of singaporeans you know
Ulta pointed out how people are also anxious on losing job and unable to find another due to the current economic climate inside my mom lost her job because of the whole damn it how did she take it I don't think she took it very well so she spend every day at home and she's just like no craving to get out because she's like me we have to go out every day but I think she made good use of the time do next time to pre-write so she just make use of the time staying home and getting her mental state back to how it was previously and fortunately I know she has found a new job that is agreed because her job is not is not one way you can work from home but it's great you know so what about you girls do you know of anyone who got rich friends duty covid-19 not necessarily but I think it was really difficult for parents right especially if they have you
kids because the kids are home from school home base loading and and I seen like I'm meeting with my boss where the kid is actually coming into the meeting at it and just like Mommy Mommy can we play and you can just tell the parents while you're doing okay but yeah I think a lot of people you know face the job insecurity over the last year and because of that that's probably why mental health declined as well have Snoopy and we wouldn't you know when you talk about mental health it's not just one thing right it's a buildup of many things and I think this pandemic really really slight every single thing that they had for us because you're releases were taken away from you and then these are the challenges where you know placed upon you right you know it was like jump instability people worried you know didn't know what was going to happen and then you have kids running around with HBL and I know that a lot of people complaining but it's real as well that you know it was more work for the parents that anything else it was all so you know people
open with working from home like completely something that they probably didn't do in the past that I was suddenly it was there was no fixed ours people expected to be available all the time people were doing what every single like time right because I was no boundary anymore there was no more like separation between work and home and then the release lever all gone you can sit down on outside you can go out you can you can shop outside that helps you cut in trouble nothing a lot of people than the travels a lot of us are just like losing our minds right now right about the working hours of time to get stressed because our boss's email as a text I was right but we don't decide what it is. If you working hours and don't you know this is your mental health at sick so this is just my personal opinion I know it can be hard to do not just reply to the text of the email but you have to be disciplined you have to be focused in order to get yourself back in shape exactly you have to set your own boundaries even though you know this
situation that none of us ever expected but I wanted to ask you guys right so what comes off like what you feel you worried most in this pandemic is it your job your health what's really gotten you guys stressed but I really worry about a lot is the health side of things he is I have to say suck at breakups use less scary than face to hide an alert to me for some reason they still has another fuse a lot more worrying for me because I think of all the unlinked cases suddenly that causes bleeding out everywhere the reason bukit merah one and then like this on Orchard that's Westgate jam and exactly it and I think four for me personally and maybe for a lot of people in their twenties especially I think no one expected this man to make the go on for as long as it did and many people had to celebrate their Milestones graduation 21st birthday all in the comfort of their own home and a lot of people felt
wow most part of my twenties have been wasted by the time this is done with all because obviously cannot happen because of the whole covid and by the time this pandemic is over I think I'll be too old for it
that is a fact my ass
okay okay so it is hell for me what about you what do you know about the most about this pandemic
yeah I know that I look at it right because so many people was so quick to adapt during that time the many people actually manage do you make full use of it and leverage of it you know we saw so much creative work come out of the pandemic they've been like tons and tons and tons of songs that will clearly written during the pandemic about the pandemic and you know he was mentioned before this that you know she managed to do something in the camp of her own home digitally try them from me right because I was in that case of people who know me know that it's true
but she's on take note
yes three videos that has been 3 months till 3 video with Yolanda Nissan okay but I think because I was so it was hot for me to get out of that fog for a bit it took me a little bit longer I really did struggle in that time I feel you just get out of that funk and get you do inspired by nothing Philadelphia prayer times during the CP around the CB with when I started falling into this Rabbit Hole in this rabbit hole called Korean drama
the phone I never want to tell you which one I called them but that was when I fell down the rabbit hole right time because I had no release on my emotions I knew I wasn't set because I had nothing to be said about by right and I just want to get it out what time everyday are I didn't yellow kitchen lights up all the bright light in the kitchen I don't know why the kitchen I don't ask me why nobody know is why orange lights and I'm there on the floor and I'm reaping my eyes out every single day I sit there crouched in the corner
and I cry and cry and cry all the people who even know I exist like some junkie indulging yourself in Korean drama suits at some point it was like I don't think
but you know what came out the other side and you live to tell the tale.
how do you know what on that. Right I am very very worried about something with this pain to make I'm worried about the loss of culture because you see all of our old for cos they're all shutting down one by one they support themselves the Congo digital and this is culture it's actually that will losing slowly but what's happening to seize some Hawkers with the help of some young teenager they just have to put up like a Facebook post on Instagram post for example and many people slow down to the store to support them that has been there more than one case that I seen that woman to see exactly actually right okay because I had this discussion of a friend sometime I think a while ago so that's something I do on my radio show once in awhile of which no because because they don't have the technology or you don't they just kind of depth to it right they don't know how to use delivery apps and things like that so I got people to call in and tell me where their favorite jacquez and that people should
check it out so I hope that helped. I don't know if you like she went but you know I think we all try and do our part to sort of just your way we are given the opportunity I think conglomerate that huge change faucet chains and things like that they will be able to withstand this no doubt but it's your independent Hawkeyes your Independence Mall restaurants cafes I think those are the ones that really really need your help right now if you can just you don't run out to get it and still ordering if they don't offer delivery I think that really helped for sure so that's for our f&d Hawkers and here in Singapore but I have one question for both of you what do your family members or your other half's worried about most about this pandemic okay so my boyfriend has his own business trade and I think businesses have really taken a huge hit off the circuit breaker last year the they were really struggling I think and this year that he actually told me yeah I don't think I can survive another such a break up because I don't own a business
it must have been so ridiculously stressful for those who do my goodness it makes me so sad to hear that ASAP I got nothing to do with my car but I'll still come now or you want me to do what do I buy coconut that's how I can contribute for my sister herself she's an employee I think she really worried about losing this job getting retrenched due to the entire economic climate I think this is the walls of employees all employees out that you even ask for example like who knows what will happen tomorrow right and I
but I think it is a legit Consin alleged worried too actually I think someone lost your era has Bill scares well I think he had a little light retrenchments care and that freaked the shit out of him because at that point I think we just bought a house as well so it was a very big concern right because you know the financial Market was not great at that time and because his company has been in the process of shifting their operations overseas to places where laborers lot cheaper and things like that so when the pandemic hit in the CB and everything I think they were downsizing game Singapore they thought that okay do what does the time we cut all the Singaporean we move everything over here is because sometimes
are one helluva boss has been blessed love you yeah she's a kite whole thing and think and think for a cotton function when you stress where is I'm the one who will like it didn't happen that they still retained on team Sia so he still has a job we're still okay
right so it'll moving on is listeners out there listening to are you experiencing this anxiety distress which is going to show if you are on how to keep your mental health in text and just walks but before that she is now seeking mental health health is not all doom and gloom do psychologists the increase in those seeking help may be due to the covid-19 all the point of Greater awareness of mental health issues and reduce stigma in seeking professional help so please don't do paise or life make that call it helps you go ahead go for it yet and this increase awareness of you know mental health issues can also contribute to lots more initiative. More funding in this area so let's keep talking about it and that's really making an open and honest conversation that's right and I think if you're afraid about what people might think you know the stigma and things like that I hope it just remember that you don't owe them a living you do what you need
to get oneself at work
okay so she has some health lines where you can seek help from or you can always call up the national care hotline that's 1-800 202-6868 there's also the Samaritans of Singapore one 800-221-4444 and if you need more help like you can get it at they prepared. SG flash my mental health so that same anybody that you can click on I need support now and that's where they can give you no help line and the specific supports that you need right and why I this is totally not sponsored okay with you. Because we feel that you know he can be helpful before yourself of her friends of family members who need it absolutely and you know this is not exhaustive this other things that we know of if you know other hotlines and other help lines and things like that to share it with us and will be more than happy to you know shirt with the listings of hash definitely and if you are in a situation at home where it's a dangerous situation not having you
mentally maybe there are some resources that you can talk to as well just know that we're always thinking of you and we are always here to talk to you guys so you know we we did talk about this I think reducing stress while you're working from home and we all have our different ways Hazel said that she likes to write down everything she needs to do yes yes yes I actually do you guys can I call you do that I'm going to tell you but he's a little things love illegible guys out there why this woman already is the best Destiny write a whole list she'll tell me baby don't forget do this do this do this bring this ring this ring this okay
can you marry Hannah
oh my God Little Boxes here so whenever I'm done with it I just letting you know some place for the day and I feel good about myself never underestimate the power of freaking to do this are very very good when you check it off it's like yes I did something that you're not exactly I make my dick productive
yes you mentioned that you would like to walk around at home all day I spent on everyday right so when I get very stressed it sounds like a week all good night my thoughts you know sometimes you just like so many things in your mind that you don't really know what to say what to do what I do in that time while I figure out the free sample I'm going to start a squad but I'm figuring out how to get passcode undone that's what I please around the house I see I see what other well you know what tips do you guys have all this in us to reduce stress while you were working from home it's super parent is like almost every day on my Instagram story go for an exercise session enjoy my face face why no media has beat just like a post another 30 minutes or a session in the gym or
a fight you or something like it easier I can you show me every day for $0.04 for the entire four hours is easier way to protect your energy so I can you do you can just get a higher from the table just do your work standing up with MediaCom I bought us all those treadmills because I want a pretty good idea I mean
a slow stroll of doing your work on the treadmill really really for me I would say making tick tocks but to be truthful with you sometimes that making Tik tok's gets quite stressful I would think that was exactly what the time flies when you're making it help me down where we were all at home was kind of like cooking dinner with a sub for the whole family so it would make the time to make really really nice meals and seeing the enjoyment of their faces that kind of makes us feel a lot better to my shopping
there's no right or wrong. I want to see you right now at least when I would like I'm guessing stuff like that the cues are so long it's crazy I'm just like is it your trouble money that you never use that's why you spend so much and I think so what's the name of this song in the past but now it's just like Nikki even remember I like on a weekday are the shop do you remember is it's you outside Chanel
33 ways to keep your mental health in check in and I always believe in positive affirmations it something I said that since last year to Everyday right you may call me crazy. But I'll look in the mirror and I will say Pacific about the things that you want to have any idea for example if I shoot will go well today it will all be great the Clyde will be happy you know I'm going to have a great day and I really feel like it's a self-fulfilling prophecy especially if it's small and it makes a difference you guys something that I've been practicing only on since the past week okay now I have been sort of like getting myself to write down three things that I am thankful and grateful for that happened in the day I'm grateful for today it can be something as easy as I had a great meal at home
easiest it's raining today but I got to music off safely and I'm thankful for that or it can be something like I managed to squeeze in time for like a 30-minute quick brisk walk after my dinner before my show me simple things but once you put them down into Woods or you verbalize them you will feel it I actually feel better about myself
oh my God I'm at home to get out of what they were you still in. Just letting you know I think they are also people and it's also very normal for us to fall into this little space way we feel or we see how much people are doing and I feel like I'm not doing its much I'm not doing enough you know I'm not getting my life at all day at home and things like that and I think it's important that you cut yourself some slack and not feel bad about it that you don't compare your progress with someone else's you know if taking the day off to do nothing if that helps you then so be it doesn't matter if something else I don't know run a marathon that date doesn't exactly and it could be something as simple as putting a face mask lighting a candle and busting in the smell of the candle right and there are so many different things you can use for self-care if you are someone that loves
journaling and smelling candles and all that definitely I think you can go into the cellar I find a whole bunch of different items and just take care of yourself there's even 10 items like his phone if you love listening to music I know we all do and I think I'm on that note I was want to share how important it is to document your day so far in the value went online I bought a bunch of stuff when the puzzle arrives to take a photo of you Latin boxing then I think it's important I don't dare
you hello
no but I think it's important to keep track of the little things in life you know so when you look back like what's Robinson just now when you see someone else like a date so packed you know what does she get so much time but you feel a bit nothing that you did nothing you know maybe you forgot about them maybe all the little things they sleep you know of your mind so it's actually important to document them and then I look back on your day and think I did this today I received this order this make me happy many many little things that you can do that's true and and you don't let's not compare ourselves to other people you're all you need we are all different and we all have different ways of coping and helping our mental health I think personally for me sometimes getting dressed up you know where night at even though we're at home in frumpy so I just wanted to show you guys I think we're all where are in cinema similar outfit all of the trimming so cute
come see like what from whom you could wear anything on the bus I'm the one knows right and he's comfortable loungewear great for Wilkes-Barre reasonable prices exactly where you can get that is your snacks how later
we had light candles one of the episodes of Heartland cast

the kind of life and that one more sign cut out in about an hour from today like to study of all right everybody that they have their home stuff Electronics as they mentioned the best thing is to deliver so quickly right if you need to even have next day delivery and it's free returns you just said yeah is that we have come to the end about three pot work-from-home specials a reminder to call to be socially responsible so that everything will go back to normal and we can hang out with my friends outside yeah that's right I think we really have to think about the community as a whole and being socially responsible could mean like for example you don't
clear my speaker out all you hang out in groups of Malden
"l&n you don't like hanging out with with people more than the Gathering limit you know breaking the rules flouting the rules and stuff like that let's just do our best to try and meet him my social contact so that we can all go back to normal that's right see you don't they be unwell and most importantly wear your mask and wear it properly, your mouth and your nose area okay everyone has a part to play in the fight against covid-19 and being vigilant is critical if we want to keep our freedom and we hope that you take care of yourself as well take a mental health you put yourself first as selfish as that sounds but you know if you not going to be happy people around you, be happy if you can't you know be happy and take care of yourself you can take care of people around you as well that's where I also saw that sell Frontline us from pool to stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you so much once again to listening my name is Hazel I was there a notification and"
I think people feel that they're peaceful pussies I think a lot of guys a lot of guys think that I have friends that think that until they go through some shit and they are finding a super difficult to cope with certain things and they feel like oh my God I need help is one of those things that you cannot really know the weight of it of how much therapy help it don't go through
so I know I don't know cuz I'm just a site we're just standing there like
babystacks
hey what's up I'm sorry you're welcome back to another episode of Men explain every episode we are learning so much to be honest today I have a very special guest he's 5 lb and I'm a horse and personality at the Smart local Bono me for doing stupid things on the internet and you know what I'm very proud to say that I am I'm very happy with our success is very very subjective all of us have different perceptions of it today is a bit of an extension of a previous episode because 30 minutes 40 minutes it wasn't enough you think looks will help you accelerate your career
beauty is subjective it is something everybody knows the right looks are definitely a factor when it comes to out in the street people make fun of me on the internet for behaving like a receding hairline La my forehead too big nose too big I've come to you. Just take it within my stripe and just ignore it but I mean at the back of my mind yeah that thinks of course that I am very insecure about especially because we were in such a judgment. It's it's visual challenging for me to say that it doesn't matter
into this mining industry honestly it wasn't a choice when I first started out and it's my local I was actually are in editorial that's about a ride talk about things to do in Singapore when I first started around seven years ago we will not launching a YouTube channel about when that started out and I started beating on it right because the people he has to be on camera and do things and try things and you get very organic reactions from that laugh and that was kind of where I started in it and it sends it is amazing to see how like 7 years old by seven eight years for example and things have changed the landscape has changed but obviously you know the overarching topic here today about good looks I just wanted to kick it off by asking you this
as well how important are good looks to you you can be straight up an honest because we don't we have no filter on these things to do in relationships and it looks like I'm going to be honest I every single person is more superficial right if you if you say you're not everybody is some level of superficial right and I'm definitely going to admit that I am and I am a Facebook does it look like when you first go to clubs and comes with me physically to someone first before you
I pick up a conversation and then you figure out or maybe this person supposed to know about it really depends from person to person right someone might find someone attracted
exactly that but that's the beauty about it right that it is very subjective we ascribe the beautiful is based on certain expectations provided to us by the media either like you must look like a popstar Asian people always one to look whiter than Western people always want to look at this very soon I also recall a time where I auditioned for a company it was going to be kind of a semi-permanent things I have to go back like maybe 2 or 3 times a week to do stuff with this company is moving company and they want to diversify and stuff
addition is still going to the senior producer he was at your eyes are to Oriental Oriental so it's not really a you know what for that moment I was like you know what I felt I don't know why I just really felt they couldn't back by what he says I can say to my face as well so that you have no regrets I don't think I want to work for this company on the situation so since we're on the topic of the workplace as well and you're in the buffet at me all the time does it play a part like let's say a better looking person who is supposed to be better than comes along you find it easier to be like oh yeah okay I think it was like oh yeah I trust is calling because comes of life
"looks by and when deciding whether someone is better off doing the job you feel little bit more trust in you know allowing them to take the job in the city come in and look like they just woke up I just put on whatever we found in the closet or whatever they come in right again I think First Impressions right about everything put it really well when it comes to being presentable, you have properly or let you know your shirt is I actually gives off a better impression at all this person knows how to take care of him ourselves and perhaps maybe is more disciplined and that somebody that I want on my team some people feel especially in interviews like"
sessions Rice's team is dating First Impressions I'm going to pull up this research that was actually done it in a while ago and this is Professor actually found that attractive workers were rewarded with 9% higher salary for men 5% more salary for women and for the mall the most recent one in 2021 shows that both male and female who was higher on the beauty scale were more likely to land themselves the job of your choice so I guess you know the question is do you think basil now experiences I'm not sure how many jobs you applied for it with me first did you feel like that was any sort of struggle at all in applying for jobs and I don't know in your journey
specific examples but I've always went coming to interviews and stuff I've always had that mindset right you know you're not going to be the best looking person. So you're going to shine of your personality you're going to be as candid and honest and as you know I sent it as possible if you put me in a room at 10 guys will probably be number nine on number 10 right I've had that mindset mean I'm honest with myself I know that my passport is in my looks my passport is in my personality and how I'm able to talk basically so that's always been the case when I go to interviews has always been to use my brains are further than anything else
intuitive you I don't know anything or whatever it may be that you have to rely more on your personality and really liked and that say makeup for other certain things do you see like that's a burden to you that we have Leon you do wish otherwise maybe because I think I've been doing this for so long is no longer a burden maybe it cuz I think it's become like pie so why do we send right there were times when I felt like so she win against another person and then there's always a sense of competition with someone else gets an easy gets a job easier or they get picked instantly for certain kind of job and if not more skill sets you know it's a similar skills as a percent is it because someone who looks better than me
"my dad I slowly chipped away you don't really realize it but it's deep down in your mind I want to go before influences even exist do you remember this a frozen yogurt store, of course you know probably if you are from our generation"
during the time I think I was I was 18 years old or something like that you know we we knew of this frozen yogurt and you know you just sold and you'll get by the way that is a skill okay I hate it when people saw you guys empty in the middle oh my God minutes yeah you can start work on like whatever what examples where obviously they were looking for a certain type of cut fruits as well and Paul the toppings you know into the relative
Beyond you know looking cute I looking good or what but you also have to carry it on with your skills by the looks right but the girls were serving a bat wrap
who is resting bitch face
maybe she can you send a person. I have a friend that I guess when it comes to hiring since I talked about my hiring process in which lasted all of five minutes are you involved in the hiring process at all at TSO a little bit a little bit I used to be a lot more so I ain't before I see if I'm okay I am going to kiss you yeah I'm going to give you a little bit more attention to that first part right I'm always looking at their portfolio to the interview
that's when I stopped paying attention so my little bit of a pet peeve is when they come dressed in life. Tension to put on something nice and dress up comb your hair look like you're put together every single thing you do from the moment you walked into the office right for the interview people notice from how nice you treat the the reception lady I agree with what you said you don't even in our industry I love it when you do ideas and celebrities were we are also we should be nicer than when I came from a background where
in Film Production runs a Film Production Company brand of electric company and I was also like doing a lot of pain and stuff like that like they don't give a shit about you but some people that are set apart by the fact that they would help you out or do you know what they're nice to you and stuff like that and this is a lot of character or do you want them on your team it's true it's true and to me that trumps how good-looking you are you are an asshole right no matter how good-looking you are sorry I'm just going to kick you out of reminds me of you remember like have you ever walked into like I just realize I don't know guys I feel so nervous I just woke up I feel like a true
People based on their looks right and it was heavily criticized as well for doing this and for objectifying the staff members who are meant to be the sales staff it was kind of like the the Knicks for Licor the tire and the more I thought there was so much interest in doing that job because the thing is I don't know but the moment you get high. Now I'm hot or like I don't know the reason you're essentially stroking your ego by the way these are personal views that in some way that died vicious cycle right because it's something so hard to run away from this idea of beauty
and because of that they will feel even more you know like that they deserve things right now and for me it was something that I definitely what I felt very challenged by especially when I enter in the industry that were many things I felt like I'd had to change about myself like my teeth at night is it all right I was so self-conscious about my crooked teeth when I first started and then when I started making some money than is it like going to put in money and pick my teeth law and I know you shouldn't be doing it for other people I shouldn't be doing it but I really felt like it was a little something I did to help me and leave for my self-esteem a little bit more and I guess you don't veering away from what we've been talking about now is this day and age where beauty standards a little bit different now and you know
I started to become a bit more inclusive although obviously this is going to take some time but it has definitely blood the lines between what we use the thing was beautiful and what should because it is beautiful right now right that's such a diverse way of seeing things right now so do you think that in the music industry it's it's going in that direction isn't moving fast enough what else can we do to change that perception of beauty I'm glad I'm glad that I'm very happy to see a lot more representation Stephanie skin color and I think that is two of the biggest I would say issues in the beauty industry that we weave weave for very very long whether or not things are changing I think it is yes I buy tickets a very slow pace because I think we have been so in and
that we are fixed kind of a what is beautiful model it is very difficult to kind of completely throw away years and years of life you know ingraining that you want to be beautiful you must look like a certain way before we wrap things up I just have one more question here for you so in a few cases men are seen as less competitive according to certain research and always having the easy way out apparently what do you feel about that statement and for example for men they're given more concessions even when they make mistakes because attractive men tend to be seen as more competent and ambitious we live in a very patriarchal society and this is a reality that a lot of us have had to fight with her and even for me right now I don't typically find myself in the mall mescaline spectrum of
for me I do feel that I get judged because I'm not the typical kind of man I find that being a woman is even harder for that cuz that is like a hierarchy in terms of this whole idea of what it means to be masculine feminine right the most masculine of men are usually the one seen with the most power that it trickles down right they've had to work even harder just to kind of fight that is very long is until I buy the older generation dies but even then we've the older generation even if it died right if they manage to pass down that kind of men are better than women
7 challenges that are in place in front of you that you never even asked for sometimes especially for people who are exceptionally good-looking in her industry I once I had a friend is working the medical industry okay he is a Doctor Surgeon very serious like Dave lives and writing critical surgeries has he's so good-looking so as a result he has to wear a mask all the time even during consults and just because he said that every time he doesn't coz he also is he looks quite young even though he is older than people think and he's a very good looking people don't trust him oh my goodness they're like yeah so I mean I have to say look for some people who have I just blessed okay that born with an Industries people actually don't have them I mean
statement for my particular friend who sings I Can't Live this way you know and it's just if you're in this serious industry maybe if your old I better get an older doctor maybe he's more and more seasoned experienced so I don't know whether like obviously once again it applies to everyone but this is just based on my friend some experience over in the medical field which is interesting industry-specific because the blanket idea but maybe for someone who is going to look for the one who is older yeah I like food too much.
"yes but then you want you to feel like you want to see like the places that he I don't want to know what I mean by I rather not go Badgers how are you know very interesting is I never really thought about so I mean maybe or next episode we should invite a really hot doctor not for my benefit is for our viewers exactly, they said we had today on is there anything else you want to leave without even if it comes to say self-confidence issues and stuff like that which a lot of us still struggle with to drive I think if your personality is ninety-nine percent you I think you really should reflect on your life"
I think in life is very hard to just goes on by without Samsung palinurus I'm sorry you know something that is always nice to go and put it in our efforts in whatever you're doing regardless of how well you know how how nice you look right and if you will get put in the effort and you will get somewhere you need to find Value in your life beyond just describing it to how you look at the end of the day when we watched maybe we just have to learn how to let go and not be so conscious about like I don't know what that wrinkled or that I don't know what it is I think honestly don't take everything you see on the internet
what is that you feel I ever that's a lot of things that goes on behind the scenes that you may not know don't take it at face value and trust me I would like to encourage all I would like to advocate for more Discerning viewers and audience members because then it will make the social media check the people lie on social media like in a sense that you be that checks and balances create a more holistic
thank you so much for being with us today we have to hang out again soon as we get Sid hot doctor in the studio I will be a yes you would be came for. Are you going to be the boom but we hope you enjoy this episode obviously as much as we did please like share and subscribe to our Channel leave a comment on what you think about the episode and also maybe you can least a recommendation on which hot dog.
getting a family member pointed out that was wearing a lot of accessories oh did you see to that I was I was shocked that no should I think the younger generation is very aware of these things are very vocal about it so that's very good distance I feel will always come from the older Generations in every generation used to have those people subscribing to be in the old Norm to do my dad said that to go through so I can never do that and don't know anything about toner moisturizer and sunscreen and now I'm all my real friends and even my own boyfriends like using my Chanel skincare you know all that was like what I know I know what are used to shampoo that you go down from my hit when I shower and I just do this and then I'm done to take like the bus picture
all female celebrities in a bikini women's bodies too cuz I think putting myself in that position. Compare compare against like in Minnesota how much attention I'm giving this week
Hazel it's is there a and it's to me welcome back to a brand new season of coyotes
wow we have not done that in so long only seeing if I have been keeping for quite some time with the crew are all of our audience members are you all right
we got us all happy and we could do for you to be my baby t-shirts for all the crew members because we just want to say a huge thank you you know who all of your efforts will be like right now and we couldn't have done this without them and honestly you would be willing to pass you the shit seems like a good three months ago but circumstances just didn't allow us to Los guachos
thank you for Designing this a very very beautiful illustration and Logo we are absolutely in love with love you guys okay it's true I can buy things very important to address and very very relevant so this is what we can be talking about today do you guys know about the Britney Spears Saga what do you know about it but you guys know what she's going through has been going through for a while now I have to admit I haven't been following it much of like the English side of the entertainment news growing up but I knew I didn't even look at me such and wow this woman has been through a lot and exactly so I think we'd be didn't really know what she's been going through because she has been silent for many years as part of something called a concert
and that is where basically all that any decision that you want to make on your own you can't you have a legal guardian or someone appointed to make all those decisions so she was really I think so of like a oppressed for 13 years he's been stuck in this conservatorship and so many people have been trying to start this free Britney movement for years now so she can make her own personal choices yeah she's not free to say that's my one money on even though she's been making what 131 million dollars concerts and stuff like that so was I should have been a dad and dad Jamie has been handling all the decisions by an expression though because I think he is an evil person I have to see he has been working hard to the Bone for 30 years now and basically giving her nothing she's taking all her money in fact her whole family is in on this conservatorship even her sister and her mom
how would you know how do we know for a fact that that's true you know what I mean how do we know that that is not her father caring for her you know making sure she wants hot and making sure the money is safe somewhere with you is that you know that's the Forefront of it that it's care that it's you know that she's not able to make this decision to self I think he did we give me to meet use of the mistakes that she's made ya to go a look she did this who did this did this not sound selfish but how can you take away someone's autonomy just because she made some mistakes and at that point in her time will touch on this as well she was being harassed by the media she was really being torn apart by everyone in the world under that kind of pressure when you go crazy but they all have family members are on the payroll of this comes up with the ship from it which I think is pretty
is really sad is really nice and she basically said that she lost years of her life to this she lost her dreams okay so let's turn time back back in the 2010 what happened to Britney Spears Stillwater remember is she was attacking a paparazzi's car with an umbrella what was in the middle of the night or something we were so young when this happened she had gone to a salon save her own head with Paparazzi capturing all of this and then went to beat Paparazzi scarf and the camera captured her attacking the cops yeah the way that she was positioned in front of the camera it was putting her at a disadvantage she looked Fierce she looked crazy yeah she look like she just couldn't keep myself together so I think she really was being harassed by the media and that caused some sort of mental mental health issues and
I think fatto it to basically how the conservatorship is today what is happening today she has a right to choose her own lawyer I think that's huge we're basically she will be able to fight for herself she's very open now in Instagram saying that she has lots of dreams she's angry at these people closest to her and she wants to fight back and everyone is really just helping her all right now but from what I read on the news she minutes to change a lawyer right I think it's something due to some health concerns of health reasons I think she was fighting for her own right to choose her own lawyer because under the conservatorship technically Jamie us is allowed to choose a lawyer right right right is he chooses how is it going to be okay if I can see him exactly right now but we want to talk about how the media has treated celebrities especially female celebrities when they're young I went there like 16 18 years old
Brittany included who else do you guys need Christina Janet Jackson I read about the one where she was performing was Justin Timberlake Cry and then I Justin Timberlake just stripped off like half of a bra what it was she was only supposed to ship off the top layer of revealing like a red lace bra underneath but the government just collapsed and everything just came off and I think Janet Jackson release suffered heavily for this one incident she was being called a slot you think all disgusting and stuff into do and say like oh I support you
Dixon also liked him the nipple get into the night like we blew up on the internet and she became like the most searched term back in 2004 or 2005 it was insane it was crazy and that wasn't even her choice she did not consent to having a body being shown all around and I think it's just heartbreaking I think someone else who has really been affected by the media Megan Fox when she came onto the scene as a very young actress in like 20 these sexualized her like she was just sexual icons that was no use for her apart from that in the media size and now I think this year we're stopping to gain Consciousness about it and a lot of media Outlets have actually apologized to Megan Fox saying that you know we're so sorry for the way we treat that you last time and we're changing our minds that snow coming from the media's point of view back in those times with social media wasn't so prominent you right now I'm they really have to find
"ways to make sure that the copies and newspapers and magazines are getting sold yes exactly so sometimes the Majesty take me to be a bit extreme yeah but I'm glad that they're stepping forward to say so you know exactly what I think and deposit the $2,000 I do really attacked the younger girls can you imagine as an eighteen-year-old the most famous pop star in will Britney and be honest about your virginity on camera how is that appropriate in this tea after she was married but in the end she broke it up she admitted she broke it with Justin Timberlake isn't it and what is shocking is Justin Timberlake actually talked about this openly in his interviews don't you think that's very mean I don't think you should be taking"
about the public like that he wrote a song that's why I'm so pissed
so many underlying issues today's degrees is well here like what we're looking at extreme cases but I think it even starts from the bottom of the chain you know where these things I just left I noticed or people just do it and they accept it as Noms as we have come so far from the way that women were portrayed and treated in the media since last time I mean look at look at all the all the magazines these days I try to be more inclusive include like plus size and all different sizes diversity and stuff like that but in the past there was nothing like this so I think we should be glad we're living in a time of change exactly if we agree and if you so thankful that you know in this time with social media is a platform easily available for everybody we can just pick up like that we don't have to go through traditional forms of media to have our voices heard in a we can speak up for ourselves as women and there is something I'm super grateful for but how do you get
I think women and men are treated differently in the public eye early 2000s of all male celebrities get away with a lot more agree and I would get to see even today definitely bills and general Stuart and Advantage when it comes to the sending in societies that disease that has a like a lot of things I think we moved us to sitting at a disadvantage in do I think things are improving but the disparities you there I think that this this systemic problem right in the past it really used to protect men where they can do the craziest things I mean look at Marilyn Manson you guys know a lot of reports have come out in the last couple of months where he literally help young girls against their will beat them everyday
and abuse them and now these women are coming out to see that you don't I was raped I was literally hit by Marilyn Manson you would have let me eat you wouldn't let me drink water if you locked me in a room and stuff like that what is wrong with this guy comes down to a one reason incident that really blew up the whole Chinese entertainment scene right have you guys heard of Kris Wu he was part of Axl and then he left he went to China mainland China to really like a focus on this a singing career and apparently he is a womanizer please have recently many of his own toys I would say it like how many of these days women on social media things about him how to leticia's he is
how much is Beats around and how much of an ass-whole he is like there was one report where this lady every one of his taxes even stood up to say he liked to ask his lady I might be what I heard the lady just went on social media you know the feeling where you trying to pick your nose is a toothpick
this is beyond going out of Kris Wu
look at this many people can just step up use your own platforms to go against such a huge icon degrees and almost immediately so many sponsors clients cut ties with him I think he is really seeing like a drastic drop in his income right now that wouldn't have happened back then so things have really really changed and even in Singapore I remember right from When We Were Young those Chinese Show on Channel 8 do you remember the girls in bikinis really don't want it wrote it was crazy news everyone would remember that I do crazy the league 2000 when I guess they protected women like me with some sort of pure things when we're all humans right yeah and they were
but do you think that drama could have happened now maybe for ladies for me once and tell running down Orchard Road in the beginning I don't think so because that drama in the past with shot with what we call the male gaze right where is it is shocked to see where is these days is different because they are trying to make it not so objectification you know so I know exactly what is so funny how things have changed its true in the crease who won OK Google Imagine knowing that a female celebrity has been over the sky with the sky with this guy and the top among people is just different until today don't you think so I feel
emails you would celebrate but I don't think it's right around I don't think they didn't yell yeah I mean in social media has eyes like a full OS on social media I also think that they would condemn this kind of behavior also in today's context in say the Chinese South Korea is what I feel so look at how shoul all went down as well that hole that when many people have have sex orgy
yeah when they happened he's no friend of nine years that you stood up and went against him was all it took to two unit entire career trying to send back out Noah I don't think it's going to be successful in my own humble opinion but yeah I don't think I celebrate it at all I just think sleeping around I don't know because you are a celebrity you are an artist you have high a price to pay definitely I think things have really changed in terms of how the media portrays but I don't want Singapore have you guys ever seen like maybe people that you know your colleagues fellow celebrities paper writing on it being attacked by the media or gossip sites writing about them any recollection
two years ago I think between Indian song do you remember that remember yeah where they exchanged pretty intimate like in the end on Instagram and we have no idea how that conversation go meet but it caused such a big who Halle in all honesty I feel like nobody can confirm like what relationship they are they may be for all we know just friends is bodies in the talking casually we don't know for sure why you smiling like that do you know anything I know it
but I think the boys incidents like these blow over quickly you know it doesn't really affect carry Nori and thankful because you go about like daddy drama filming and stuff like that of course they stood out to say sorry causing her to the fence and stuff like that but I think the audience in Singapore is muscle giving up then people in China or Korea
how to say okay I understand that celebrities having signed up for this life would have known what that coming in for what don't you think this is the main reason why it drives people like Britney into the state that she's in definitely definitely expectations because you have to behave better because your celebrity exactly did you know and I'm sure they have their frustrations with everything they do gets blown out of proportion that you have to take care of themselves back though when they have more strength I would say equal monstrous and you want to do the same stuff that people do at the end of the day I think we really need to just keep in mind we're all human and we all make mistakes and no one deserves to be driven to a point like that by the media and look at Princess Diana's she was literally driven to death while the paparazzi was chasing her and Meghan Markle
Harry didn't want to make it too and I'm in a situation like his mom but women and men are treated so differently in the media I mean that Charles was but no one chased him down or you know I mean no one kind of like assassinate that human a media how are you buddy
how can we make things better right that's the thing I think things have really changed with more and more female celebrities speaking up for example Taylor Swift right she used to be so hated on for writing songs about boys is that you know you have the same emotions she does but she managed to change it to my Nina and this new up-and-coming singer new album so full of very salty songs with the media fun of her exactly Olivia's number one she's being right
treatment of women in the media these days like you mention from Taylor to Olivia what are the examples that you guys had in mind that made me think that things have really changed for the better for the better but I think we social media right a lot more females are empowered to speak on their own so they can make the news you see me cuz they don't have to rely on someone else or news outlets isn't exactly like for example is o.t. is someone that is super hot working but people body shame her every single day in her comment every time I see you smile and and she basically told everyone you know what I I woke up every day I'm probably more fit that have a few guys that I do have my own body type and acceptable everyone was like yeah that's true why should she be working out to be a size zero
thin girls more the agent of contact in the US could be goals and will accept that but you know in Asia relax texting girls and this is why so many on female artists work so hard to achieve that kind of Body Korean K-Pop singers how many of them because they don't eat
do you guys know what's up beautiful
I thought you funny is good besides say Lisa Jenny for example of a difference but Beauty in her own way I also agree that the figure is absolutely gorgeous women these days I see you I think with the whole me-too movement and they realize that if you continue to attack women they would have no readership the days where you know they used to take like the worst pictures of female celebrities on their holidays in a bikini but you began this picture would go news now she gained a couple of pounds to stop eating so much what is with this obsession with women's bodies and in the Chinese entertainment
female artists after giving birth are they can go back to the prior to being pregnant is like you to know like the music event say oh my gosh what is woman even pregnant at all like a dying everyday to lose so much weight as she may be blanking 18 hours a day at home every day I'll try to heal from a childbirth exactly that's why it's so important to talk about media's portrayal of women because it affects all the young women out there right now and it puts such high expectations on them that they can never live up to exactly cuz to be honest celebrities Photoshop themselves as well as he it's a it's a it's a chain thing because the celebrity knows that the media coming out to them it will do whatever it takes to lose that you know fact let's say after childbirth
and then mothers out there was struggling with do you do newborns look at them and see if they can do it how so I can know why is my progress Chamberlain being himself the other day that I I felt so bad about myself for eating so much remember I was telling you I was telling my girl I was seeing Oh my God you know what I gained 2 kg I feel so bad and I found that why am I feeling so bad because when I watch movies when I wash a TV dramas and I see like the female that the female lead in the show Lost so skinny so fit I'm like being in this industry as a radio
I will have I will ask myself as well as well if they can do it should I be oh so you were working harder to achieve that kind of funny to to the to the extent that one day when I met like my goes again I told him you know what I'm just going to fuck it I'm just going to eat whatever I want and the English way we love you so much and we love you no matter what you really want to be happy like to think of yourself exactly and I found it I told myself I'm just going to let myself get whatever I want I was indeed happier and less because right because I don't use a pressure reverse psychology exactly exactly why I myself I'm not going to have this the more I wanted them
"be happy let yourself eat whatever you want in moderation of course you feel you'll feel good for the rest of the day so as women on social media social media is a form of media these days let us always try to support other women and let us always you know firstly don't need nasty comments on other woman's human beings are very real people in Revere real feelings at the end of the day and they will see a, at some point whether or not you know you think that all that but they might just see one thing might just push him over the edge and if you think that they wouldn't see why you didn't even come in the first place right exactly"
I love it I think that hopefully you know with all this open conversation right we can inspire you or you can be inspired to call out all these body-shaming call out people that send you nasty comments you do I used to do this way people shave me right and I screenshot and post on my story
"funny love you on social media you have your own autonomy let us take this power back in a little while with the same things like free Britney what was saying things like oh the media is treated these people so badly but right now it slips in such a way that you are the media because of the accessibility you are your own media exactly and if you don't know what that just cuz you think this unless you're driving him to the ground almonds come from accounts newly-created then come and leave all these come now, so the hell are you and I sent it somewhere online that you can't offer anything nice or for your silence shut the fuk up"
physically basically everything that you're saying all of us here have we might have you don't laugh when I see comment thought of something nasty in the past but times change and we need to change with it as well I think maybe sometimes it's in human nature you know what you just think of something you do you know make your own judgment and things like that but I think what's more important is if you're aware of it like if you think that this is something that's important it is that just catch yourself you don't know if you would have think it catch yourself and go okay hold up I'm just think of something nice that you know I mean because I think it's the end of the day it all falls down to everybody has problems that you don't know off and you don't know what they going through and you should just be kind when you can cuz it cost nothing right exactly and I think the mole
maybe when you hang up a friend's you just got them about it a bit there's no need to take it on social media or like comment on that person's photo of video you know and make it like publicly seen or heard but I think we have really reached a new era in 2015 was off at unemployment and media Outlets are aware of their responsibilities more now than ever of you know whatever that they say you could impact young minds everywhere for example you guys know they will make sure right when Jesse Nelson actually left it was huge news but she had left because of her mental health if she can't stay any longer I don't think she even be with us right now so she had to leave and everyone was so understanding okay what's going on Mental Health let us give her the space she needs all the fence was so supportive and that's something that I could never see happening in the early 2000s
"groups right now, human body was twice what is the members was feeling a bit like depressed and just all the time and then she took a step back and the company that goes with supported her decision on what you know will give you space takes how many to he'll come back when you're ready"
performing dog in singing all the time sheet this is this is something go when Julian from Shiny Brite and following that incident are you using for a good friend and she said something which I think May everybody's off to sit up and listen for a minute and she said listen on these people are out there to perform for you to make you happy and to create for you but in that process they need to heal themselves as well you need to know that the humans they fall sick they feel unhappy and they're allowed to feel unhappy allow them to feel the feelings they have to portray himself as perfect as happy
and I think she said that everybody just saw a setup for a minute and just listen do you know who everyone is it so important to understand how can we change to prevent more similar incidences from happening so I think right now to women struggles with mental health and the reason why I think we struggle a lot more because of gender-based abuse in a lot of abuse is targeted at women and men and while there is a lot of change ready I think they're still mall to be done especially if you know you are the owner of a media Outlet you need to set the agenda that you cannot do this for example I'm just last week Blake Lively she's got two kids with Ryan Reynolds the paparazzi have been chasing her kids down trying to get a photo of a kitten and post it up without consent
here is what we can all do it collectively to stop this from happening don't click in don't share it don't consume the content if you don't get them the profit they can learn from it if there's no demand for that Quentin it will die because they need to find something with its profit she made a statement at a call to everyone in the world to protect women and children everywhere this incredible so don't consume the content and they will not have a business and as long as we know which way to go I think change will happen. I think I remember a similar incident I know Angela baby as long as they have a little sponge together very cute and very insistent on not letting so high means mom
"but it's okay well they were outraged that I remember they were out with her and be to get social media or the reporter had to take down the photo and everyone yeah it was really nice to see you as well we also want to say that you know what was going on what was focusing like women you know the portrayal of women in media and things like that we do understand that these things are happening the guys as well as of course I was just saying quite recently actually that I feel quite recently I feel especially in K-pop I think the guys are getting sexualize more than two goals right now it's not okay as much as you know we're trying to protect a woman right now and everybody's on the edge right and use Outlet to know when it comes to women that okay they're very sensitive because they know people will come at them, but I think at the end of the day it's a human thing it's a decent season yeah yeah not just women but also how are men being portrayed in the media but yes the rise of social"
he has allowed these celebrities to gain control and have a direct channel to talk to that fence that's right. The struggles that you're going through social media messaging platforms at this Valley's online you you don't have to have the number of the celebrity if you have like the username you guys can be in a group chat together that other countries to do that quite a bit like online or like a on whatever this is also a way for celebrities to just get out there with the fence without the influence of other platforms and all the other media channels for example definitely so they can control the story they don't have to go through these media Outlets that will twist there was something different and I think that's the biggest change in the last couple of years raising strong women
do you know fight back against the system exactly I think we should always keep a I'll positivity and you know don't leave nasty comments on social media has been kind you don't understand that the humans is that that day so sick of what you're supposed to be perfect you're supposed to be happy I'm so tired I need to be with someone I just saw you at I do bad for doing that I feel like oh my God I like picking up like more resources in Chinese and Korean children song like a you know the past few months have I wouldn't have enough all like I said I shouldn't be like bothering people with all these kinds of negative sentiments
but I see the Liberties like for example Khloe Kardashian when I see her staring open the about how has been cheated on her and stuff like that that makes me feel that you know
even the people that we think are the strongest the most perfect day goes through these things as well and it shows your audience that we don't have to be perfect all the time so you don't have to be perfect all the time but I think we're all just human exactly and on that note I like I mentioned the past few months have been such like I have been an emotional roller coaster for so many of us. Like if you really need someone to talk to please talk to your teachers your family members or friends you know make sure you get these things off your chest when you feel like I do but going to someone with my problems they probably have their own problems I'm being no a bother I'm being bothersome I hope you don't feel that way because I feel like
he will be more than happy to really just hear you out yet so don't discredit yourself that way and get the help that you need me exactly true friend would always be a shoulder to cry on and always a listening ear YouTube always have my shoulder

hi welcome back to something private it's a special episode
you know the guy didn't find one of the food she has Allison Camp off strip
they have another brand called tulips and invited us to join them on Sunday to Mission did you guys about stuff that's right I'm talking about talk about it was so cute all the time but she is a big part in our overall health and well-being so how do we get a little pissed in a five-part miniseries every last Wednesday of the month
don't coronavirus today I like to thank our friends at tulips and strip for Kimmy up with us on this bypass special on topic at one of the palace and its sister brand tulips which invented the world's first luxury range in to provide solutions to make women feel more power in their own bodies
this is our last episode of the series where we spoke with a range of experts from a doctor specializing in sexual health Total Health Care Center in Singapore empowering women to take charge of your sexual and reproductive Health in the description box below my name is Becky and I'm 26 years old this year I am the founder of hockey and as well as a team SG surfing XP currently living in Bali
New Years now I got to go I was very high all the cases but now it's now it's getting better how you managed to get yourself to understand how I got to Valley High School light rewind 56 years ago when I was still in University when I finish my a-levels I really wanted to go to I told my mama okay if I do well for a-levels and if I get into the university can you can you pay for my surgery because it actually did happen a lot of us when we think about Bali I don't feel I love nothing about surfing how come that way
15 years old that exploring a lot of activities and I was watching a lot of TV shows and they know they low and Stitch was a big thing back then and then suffering was a heavily featured in the show because base in Hawaii so because of that show I was like okay this is something I really want to try out I don't know why but I really want to do it and when I got it and I never let you know about this state like the Flow State like when you do something you can you forget everything else around you you're just like so focused on this once before and you were able to fully immerse yourself into a certain activity can be music
and then because of that experience I just kept going back to Barley and so my personal goal I was like okay how can I get to Barley & Serve and not working a corporate job that I can only have like maybe 2 weeks to a month of holidays a year like I don't I don't want I don't want that I want to have my own freedom and during my second year of University and thought your puny Varsity that was when I started working on a genie and Genie is the reason why I can be here in Bali today interesting to tell me a bit about getting some real at what height and he is obviously we are so my company but then there's something a lot more deeper than that because when I first saw the high Genie I was quite alone in my journey of surfing
are you know University you always go with a group of friends to buy Lee and then and then have fun there but then I was the only one who wanted to serve and I always felt so alone. Okay I guess nobody I can do this with I knew that there were girls who wanted to do it it just random girls saw my Instagram profile and then they started messaging me about it so we would literally just meet up and we have never met before I go on a safe trip and then suddenly I just kept getting more and more requests and when I also started surfing I bought a lot of swimsuits and it didn't work they kept falling off or like it was good for like maybe
two three four times and then after that the that the material stretched out sounds like hey this is something that we are lacking in the market this is back in 2017 2018 yeah I know it's not many friends you want to focus on functionality first and foremost and then the second part is Green Girls Together homegrown Singapore and Brenda are having a lot of goals have identified as you know kind of bee go to swimwear brand if I can say so that comes up and I need as well the reason why we resonate with so much is because of I guess I like the way you can freeze angles are or how they represented on social media to through the pictures and photos and stuff right
that's a bit about how you use like bikinis and like he needs and surfing right to be a tool of empowerment on that body positivity because I think you know when you think about it it's not like the most empowering kind of outfit for a girl right in text Nancy highlights lovely our insecurities and not negative thoughts that we have ourselves a new the sudden image that I wanted to portray which is definitely not like hiring 16 girls to represent my summer because I'm not selling to those girls and actually selling to people who are just like me average size or a little bit bigger and basically what it is what it is is through just help our customers imagine how they would look like in a bikini and it's not just about how we look like I also how we feel like we feel Carefree we feel empowered and we don't we don't really care what people say
are saying about our bodies because all we want to do is to focus on that activity which is it could be surfing could be like diving so very consistent with the fact that I just wanted my customers to wear it and people who look like my customers who wear it and then I get a lot of messages saying that for the first time in my life I feel comfortable wearing a bikini like back then I have a lot of customers who didn't get any bikini at all after trying a guinea for the first time then their bikini Journey kind of begin from there which I find is like one of my biggest motivation to continue this even on my God this is so difficult but then I think about my customers and encouraging messages they sent me about how they feel more confident in a bikini while that is
I think that is like the best thing that has happened to this friend yeah but y'all on the uncomfortable of your own body and how you can move past it.
I think this is okay this is when I was 13 when I was warm I felt like I didn't want to know what the funny thing is that my mom was so I will push me to wear a bikini because it's time to like 5 I didn't always about okay I want to look at it today I don't want to eat today and I don't look like by surfing I don't really talk about this was something that gave me a lot of body confidence because you're not just focusing on your body
if I'm connected to your training and when you see others suffer goals I rocking a bikini stuffing as the best that they can just make it gives you a lot of motivation is Marva my body anymore this is about what my body can do I need to change my mindset and I know that this is not how I feel and I know that is not how I want other girls to feel I'm interested in your body just now but like yeah I think it is because there's no. I know people have you asked me to make small bites look bigger than they are that you get one slight very nice
don't be so confident in your own skin do you put on a pair of like how do you like confident how do you have
that's a really good question because I always thought that light let's say okay in one group for example Dare for girls one girl tries to bikini and it looks good obviously the other three girls want to try it out to and then they realize that wait this is actually so much better than my other bikinis that I have and it's all about light and gauging that one influencer or like opinion be in the group which dares to try these bikinis out and then they will naturally lighten to a different to do the same way one person buys it and like oh my God this is great let's go get more people ask you what about my butt like what if it's revealing but it's okay
I think when your friend tells you it's okay then naturally you'll be like yeah it's okay feeling but not sexualized you know I don't sexualize my models I think I just want them to be the Natural State I want them to be confident and I wanted to be happy where I like little fat sticking out when you show that and not just screaming into someone's face the people who are right for the grand the people who fit the house are you at market doing that really want to try it out and see how we do that inside resource for the materials that doesn't stretch out and you can that you can sub something that you can use for let's say 2 or 3 years and then when I designed the bikinis I also
take into account that okay how would this fit on the waist when people be comfortable like standing up or sitting down laying down all these kind of different situations you want to take into account that has to be comfortable and for the bottoms is it's very is quite straightforward like instead of like Griffin whining that usually see is fast fashion companies actually double line them so that its fake and nothing nothing shows like your Volvo won't be showing and also for the tops it goes through a lot of testing first test it out of the water jumping around doing yoga whatever and then we have to go into the water and then when you go into the water it's a totally different story because child the fabric becomes when it's wet is it heavier and does it have like extra fabric coming out or is it revealing is it revealing
chest area even though I'm online it's fine like all these different consideration comes into play and then that's why we take a lot of time in designing you cuz they make people feel really good about their bodies
I want a little bit about body positivity in your to be like you know just wear something in you you feel comfortable don't care about what people think but the reality is that a lot of the heat right that we have a lot of negative self-image we have about our own body right comes from like we've been so I'm wondering how do you can if I married the to write having like a being an owner of swimwear company you know something that usually seen as I'm sexy and you don't really truly at holding life but body positive body positivity supposed to be a tough question because I have gone through that face off light one and two descendant wanting to fit into this I Perfect Image and then as I start my company I don't want to be perpetuating this idea of having the perfect body before you can wear a bikini I want people to be happy in their bodies because it is my Chinese
I am praying with this company like some days I feel like everything is it's two different ends you're being told to like one end is where you're loving your your body first and loving your your curves you're loving your flaws and not not need it and not being pressured to change anyting where the other side is like I'll be much happier if I looked a certain way you know I feel like that is something that a lot of girls are struggling through I personally like have talked to some of my customers and I keep up with their stories and recently I saw a post from one of my customers saying that life is always a difficult Journey with your body like some days you feel good about yourself and then the other other days you really want that change so I think that you can love your body but you work and also want to change it at the same time
and this is what I've been going through like okay I loved and I love my body but I think that my mind and my confidence will improve if I start going to the gym if I start being active again this is something that I want to I want to share and Hiking is that you don't yes we can look good and we can let my body the way it is but change isn't bad either yeah somebody who has pictures you every post that right and that you know girls that are not that don't fit the conventional kind of like a standard of beauty although I know about how do you say
so nice to see you sing that in general like in a society like those are becoming more you no self-respecting in like you know putting themselves and definitely I think I'm always so happy when someone post a photo in the hockey and they're rocking it with that confidence that to me is like my motivation to 12 design got a bikinis for them and is also teaching me that I need to let love myself more something private is a podcast produce on the local media publisher or grandfather sorry this episode in collaboration with our friends & BBQ Express Script and tulips
so while we're on the topic of these have already thinking of my next trip to the beach the same you should also be thinking of applying sunscreen around your house to give you a call because it's all skinned and it needs protection from the Sun are formulated with spfk focused mainly on the face and body of an even more delicate areas nearby the bikini line which makes it perfect for whole body use on pool and Beach days about this product check out now back to the episode
Thomas drewyor process of like how you saw that materials what goes into your mind when thinking about creating a bikini but I use that you want to help hold first of all the song everything is done in Bali my sourcing is from what basically what is available here also Follies is so close to Singapore it's much easier to just hop on a plane and come here and then just start looking for suppliers a lot of independent brands from Australia and
do like a sickly hundred percent of the production so knowing that I'm actually came to bother you know so that I can suck you so white why not like to kill so I can lift you I can serve and I was I can also grow my business yeah
one before I started fussing for my Fabrics I looked at like the look I look at local auctions in Singapore as well but I try to look for assume you don't even have like a fabric colors and textures and you can also print your fabric there which is awesome Fabric and equally and locally locally sourced locally sourced and then for our recycled Sumer it comes from Italy and some of the fibers are from China but then they bring it to Indonesia and then they leave it here in Java
when I when we first started obviously if you wanted to focus just on stuff in bikinis something we can use I I mean bikinis that will stay on so some people actually take my niece to go to yoga to go to go whole dancing the first time that I received an Instagram story mention of someone really cool obviously because I hang upside down and they won't they don't want to fall but she showing yep yep yep I guess they tried it out and then I started getting more pole dancing customers customers because they asked me two or three or four things that's why I had to be like at least three fingers wide and inform to be safe so I
ever since then I have designed my bottoms to have feta Volva coverage for like my ICICI
I didn't know if you think about it like most customers in Singapore they just kind of weather that I can use to go to the beach club if you called out hey I rent
don't really eat that much of the water and then best or anyting but yeah it's like stand-up hatchling and and like sitting at the beach club
this is fine but he said not much activities to do ya do. Everyone was great baby kitties to jump into the waterfall your pay you need it to stay on right now you're stuck in Singapore mostly 80% of my cells come from Singapore and I know that light sometimes it's also it's also may be time for me to explore more like Lounge pieces so my a white range of activities a wide range of situations and also being able to like resent them in a way that customers would understand and not just like can you see a pretty photo off all summer and then you buy it I don't want it to be a more like meaningful relationship so all the cuts are with the customer in mind and what they would be doing at that moment that if you need more cover
is that an area that's what mine when designing a bikini can I put a push-up do you have to switch out padding unfortunately so I try to design them in a way that like will make it look at the ring bottoms people have consented like muffin tops so usually they want like we have that option for them and
like higher Bikini Bottom says it's higher at the waist
Saudi I like 80s cut halfway through your belly button so we are actually in the process of ballet shoes if you want to lengthen your legs this is a bikini bottom that you can choose if you want more coverage because those had like a very flattering light princess night light and also great for girls with very big maybe walk around like that top that it's a bit more but in recent years I wasted a lot of people more focused on like the the bottom
booty butt cheeks definitely still cheeky with like a wider band but you know I always tell this to my customers that cheeky bottoms stay on better than full coverage bottoms and I'll tell you I'll tell you why when you're surfing or when you're doing any water sports the full but coverage actually has more surface area for the water to enter in and push it down by 6 Shiki op your booty and they have lesser off right so the water cannot push it down as yes yes yeah so that's why I like I love why she keep all them sister and you stay on a lot better and usually the chicken
scrunched up in the middle of your booty also because I mean if that's the line of logic write in used it like less like particles in bacteria and I could get into your body
I definitely need it on for like an hour but in a lot of people are very have a very sensitive to getting a bb or any other infections so they have to make it a point to just hang out up there because in the ocean although it's really good for you like on you for a long time I talked about like changing out a bikini bottom and I personally prefer to wet or sugar but ultimately that decision
it just passed my preference but if someone wants to remove your hair or not is totally up to that is totally fine and I also think that we should judge someone for not doing it all for doing it even though we just only offer needs at the moment I also extending into cash cards and make cereal doing will be doing myself suits and also liking because I think that if you're someone who is under the sign of your you're exposed to a lot of like you he raised and from 10:10 a.m. on Wednesday 3 p.m. if you're constantly Under The Sun It's better to just take a skin wear a scarf and leggings and even a hat and zinc sunscreen that must have a zinc oxide
protector that protects your skin so you don't get wrinkly as yeah I think you had your own thing right I mean I don't want to say this but silver is a really sore official Society you're right
yeah and we can go a lot deeper into this next time or even just like just me and you but it is how we look like it is what we do how much money we earn and less on what we can do for ourselves and for other people to hiking me I do not want it to be so superficial the item of clothing to express yourself but it is true suffering volleyball pole dancing it has to be an article that empowers you to do something like that
that's really nice when we fought when we shift our Focus from what all what is it looks like to what I can do I think that really helps you to overcome that body image issues don't focus on the Angola but focus on just showing up if you want to do something show up and if you want to love your body you can just magically expect yourself to like love your body when they have to take steps to what's noticing what you like about yourself or make a point to be grateful for what you have and not why you don't have as much as I also like Spiral right but
do you want us to figure out what you want and then she got two steps to achieve it and I think about what you have will bring a lot of gratitude to yourself and your body will buy it for what it already is I think one thing that is so striking about you as an individual is that you are a young woman who San Francisco at the right but you would like to know what I'm done I'm leaving I'm going to go put some of my dreams and leave all of your dreams right so confident you know like what you not afraid in in in making that step something
everybody face at one point it's like they're kind of looking to other people and that I do care how did she do that then
in the beginning I never saw that I couldn't and I think that is why I am here now it's because I had like a self-advocacy to remove myself from away from Singapore to Bali and just see how it goes I think all of us are very fortunate
in Singapore a lot of people don't want to take that for me this is something that I could handle but maybe not something that other people could handle I make my made up my mind to movia so it is all just in the mine yeah it's just all in your mind that I cannot do I look at someone else to do that you know I can't do that
actually you can you can do anything you want to do to everybody who is listening just take that stuff at first that mother is at contacting suppliers watching YouTube video on think about like 10 steps ahead
it's going to it has really no loss

it's a bit tricky when it comes to like dress code for things like that because I do believe maybe from the company's Centauri is it emits and it going for but at the same time I think this my back didn't even think about it right sometimes we feel like if I dress up today and I look good and I feel good I feel like I'm going to take on the wall and I'm going to produce great work today has to do with you as well thank you think maybe that's what companies thing is that if people come in and whatever they want do that they might just feel too comfortable or you know it makes them feel like you're not setting a head straight to get what done

I've come to the end of this wonderful Episode by
hi welcome back to something private this is a special episode by the music right
"you don't know guys didn't run one of the Fuji heavy Google, let me take a stripped Phillips and you can buy them. That's right I'm talking about you and little embarrassed to talk about. It was so cute all the time in cranberry juice all across social media about friends at tulips and strip in a five-part miniseries every last Wednesday of the month"
September 2nd and we thought who better to ask to celebrate the king back control of our house so long waiting times expensive Health back home as well as some of the common birth control options available and its side effects as well as why discrete affordable and convenient access to birth control is a busy right now on my name is glorita I'm the co-founder of East for those who don't know he's he's a digital Health startups let's focus on women's health we offer Service delivery of birth control emergency contraception at home estate testing Sexual Health complications I meant to help constipation so we're trying to make the whole set of women's health experience a lot more convenient access you on the street
special on bubba keg got to work first but douching for women 50 and besides I think you guys send each other sexual education on my end I had never seen a phone like this before becoming a bit more about how did you guys stop even to think about you know are on this Earth experiences accessing section reproductive Health in Singapore both my partner and I had hot so certain that experience certain barriers to access that made us do y'all think of this idea
personally I saw birth control user when I came to Singapore I was having a lot of issues that's the same birth control whether it was because he don't like judgment from doctors that I wasn't expecting or unwanted advice but also just leaving convenience of having to go down to the clinic like every month or every few months just to get a birth control refill I thought it was quite an inconvenience but then I started so if that looks and Works website anyways and try to understand little bit more whether you know this was like kosher like shocked or was it like other Singapore women also experiencing these things and so I found out that a lot of people were quite concerned about how we know we talked about sexual reproductive Health in Singapore how we access to services so that made me realize that okay there's a huge demand for this and there there is a got that from the start we didn't want you to be just a telemedicine popcorn we wanted this to be you know a community space a space to ask questions I fix to get information on vacation and so yeah I think we would try to
come up with some medicine cups from that was a little bit more comprehensive and helpful and in certain ways that you don't quit transporting a person's life and how they access he seems to think a lot of people in Singapore and think about like sexual health for you and I like we kind of both started out cool inspired you to stop being serious in this state I think we were just playing before this about how my experience is in Argentina I really took back to Singapore right and I think even though we didn't have like the best sexual education possible people were really curious and asking questions from a very young age I think and I think our parents and our Educators and people are very open to giving us information guiding us through the process I personally Francis in terms of contraception I was having you know it regular
I was experiencing these are really bad cramps and my mom was actually the one who is lagging on why don't we speak to other colleges and see you know what Solutions are there for you so I'd that's when I started realizing that there's a whole journey of sexual reproductive Health we went down to the other guy knee and she talked about likes of contraception the options I had available you know she talked about a pap smear in the future and STI tests all these words that you know started coming up and so I mean it's but later on that conversation kind of naturalization signing into email starting to be sexually active and asking those questions that I've been more sensitive right but I think it was just a I was quite curious to understand my body and my health and I was lucky enough to have people around me to email guide me through that
when it says some of the common things that you can make you happy that you would definitely get Crimson dye into something they can you buy Freight in my room sometimes a cultural experience what it is to be a woman like what your experience has made me think of partly why we started started the minstrel held consultations with because I realize that I love my friends are experiencing like severe cramps right and yes if your crumbs can be just so you know and I know part of your. But sometimes they might be tied to our condition and see how it is important to find out what the root cause of the things going on having someone to just talk to you not professional clothing that you in that process in that journey of finding out
I think it's super important at making that access who wishes he if you don't have those support networks are on you like my mom who was like able to just email take me to a gynae friend in Singapore is also a lot of them don't have very good experiences going to be on Monday 1 to ask for like birth control it often goes to like them control to regulate I would like to treat like a condition of messages on Instagram from people just sharing their experience and experience I asked if they could like we could share them publicly as well anonymously of course and yeah I mean it's pretty much the same story over and over right people going down to
facing a doctor who in am I going to be very aware of birth control giving you nothing just seeing maybe it could be you or providing you with the tools to make an informed decision and sort of like feeling really lost in the whole process like that there's a huge people and surrounding these issues I mean you can't expect all doctors to know every single part of medicine refill and birth control is it sexual and reproductive Health he's not some doctors my friends and I know it's fine right but the thing is that they might not be providing you with the information you need to to make a decision for yourself right and that's that's really important as something that we're trying to change when you came to the sample to rinse it off like a weird situations the first one was when I came here I had to change my brand because the brand was unavailable and I explained very clearly to the doctor that I wanted to stay on the same hormone compass
and I was taking and I mean all brands have the same poor month but the friend dosage levels right so that would to me was really important and I explicitly said that in the consultation when I pay for the pills to come home I realized that the dosage was completely different he was the same hormones which is different and indigo me really upset because later on I started using them experienced side effects like something that I wasn't I think because I would have been on them for like 3 years already right so so that was the first set of experience that was more in the the lack of Education from the doctor and like explaining you know what I was thinking you know what a white hat changing the second experience was when I missed a pill so I went very diligently done to the doctor to to get emergency contraception and basically I stayed in the clinic for like 3-4 hours it was a really long queue and when I came in here with a male doctor and basically he was like they want my City emergency contraception
give me to look down and is that okay and he was liking all that you need to take care of yourself like why are you in the situation and I explained that I'd miss a pill I'm being extra cautious like I want to take care of this myself right and he was super judgy that just not like do you know this I want advice as I mentioned before and the worst part is that I asked for a doctor's note or something that proved that I'll have been in the hospital and the clinic for it for 3 or 4 hours and he was like no like you're not sick like I'm not going to let you know basically you hanging on to cover you for blessing I should have taken care of yourself and I remember that phrase you should have taken care of yourself so it really made a huge impact on how I saw these things going on I feel really changed for for for making a decision which I shouldn't have
anyways like the way I think that was like a huge like a woman for me and that's where all the work she wasn't that looks came from cuz I was like it can just be me that is experience in this right and I didn't think that that was not for a Coleman to me so it's like you know are the other women here yeah we turn it turn out to be there so many options like honesty at the moment both on the pill the patch the ring they can plan the shot on the IUD I know he's goes on at whichever side effects of course they are always tight back to the hormones in in the
the contraceptive method you choose old most of the contraceptive methods out there have both at two types of hormones by estrogen progesterone and they provide that those hormones in different levels basically how your body reacts to email those hormones hit space unlike those levels as well as like how your body receives that and usually takes 2 to 3 months you know for your body to adapt to his son side effects to know that people might experience during these two to three months has on headaches some changes in your. So he might come a bit earlier or later than expected you might make me bleed between periods another one might be the mood swings Navy and it really depends on like how you react to the thermal contraceptive method that you're using a VIN if it's a means of prevention there is sort of like a release is your crimes like your periods are a lot lighter it regulates your. To 28 days
so you know some people might have a once in every few months so it will regulate it to 28 day cycle so yeah there's like side effects that I mean fortunately it's mentioned before like because of how much do these methods have evolved there they are really temporary and they should go away and if they don't it's fine to change my sister to change Brands and see which one works best for you I want to know his birth control of your life so I started birth control yeah when I was seventeen on back then he was mostly because I was having irregular periods are really bad cramps and then like I wouldn't mention that it was a good choice for me to stop. Pain later on course I do is for pregnancy prevention right now I'm used to being kind of to control my acne breakouts and he's working really well I don't see you before you do for me
being in control of all these aspects of my health I always keep my periods with birth control and that have seen men for me that every month I don't have to skip work because I can't I don't have very heavy bleeding and means I don't have crowns on so it has to be extremely transformative my life and of course I am not looking for birth control by I'm also not like pushing it on to other people I think there's something out of contraceptive methods are there so it's about just using what works best for you but for me has been really like life-changing and he has made me just felt like really in control and a few times where my brain was out of stock I freaked out cuz to me is basic health care at this point so anything I'm so I had done my research before I started and I consulted three different guy needs to understand and in fact actually I found out just because the first thing I went to she was like oh
I was already on birth birth control but my cramps were still a bit bad and she was like why don't you just keep your periods entirely and I was like you can do that like how and she's like yeah you just did you just take birth control back-to-back instead of having a break so they're break triggers or the placebo pills 2 years ago. So I'm just not taking any breaks so yeah it's not I'm not sure if I can give you is kind of like a crazy 5 but the. That you get it during birth control is technically technically not here. You're not ovulating right so it's sort of gets triggered by the hormones in birth control entirely because technically you're not on your.
information I think it's something I mean again it's important to consult your doctor figure out whether that's something that that goes to do that it's the only good for you you and your health and your mental health as well you know like you know how I am. Time since my make people feel a bit uncomfortable and that's fine right for niece has changed my life completely and I'm really happy about and of course I continuously go to the 92 checks and everything seems to be fine so and there's a lot of fun. Some not be like inconvenient and every once a month
yeah. And he's and stuff like that. Like helping make you but I mean personally I prefer to have it
just to add on to that conversation I do feel like in my whole life. Jameela it's been exactly like you say that it's been quite interesting because there are so many different options available in books I shall Grant it was a short break on the local meat meat in collaboration with our friends & BBQ Express Script and tulips you might be extremely lucky and rest of us and sometimes on B days struggle with conditions like dry skin

VIP to find out more about prior to signing a podcast my impressions of control work right away what control pills and night yeah yeah I used to assume that like taking birth control is a way of pregnancy prevention and I used to think why is it
I can you do not wear condoms for the consequences of you guys kind of stuck with a Christian and some of the women in a population that he know it's not just about any means something very different to different women tried some people are taking it for instead of pregnancy prevention our people are taking it because they have a say in the mattresses and they're controlling some of the symptoms of in the with birth control other people are using it for the acne prevention that's completely fine as well I think I'm fortunately the word referring to the term birth control contains the idea of birth and inside it and I think that's worth a lot of his friends were trying to change the did the conversation going to start of email find out what works for you what you need. We can help you you know I'm different on a personal basis I think it's becoming more and more of like a
empowering to for when I think 2 to take back control of the hell did they buy control their sexual part of life as well to be able to say in all like sure let's use condoms but I also feel very insecure about the fact that I'm using my own kind of protection you know it's important for women to to to be able to make that decision figure out what they needed for figure out if it's the right fit for them as well and no use it for their lunches around why do we have to be to go to let the trial and error I not see that you know something but I mean there is I think a lot of questions surrounding why is there no like hormonal male contraceptive and I think that's a really interesting question and I'm hoping that in the next couple years you know we will have the same kind of choices both formal and informal for women who you know my not I mean I mean on her mom but for me also to take that burden as
but I guess but I think that I think the pill has evolved so much for him like I like the side effects of birth control high like 15 years ago is completely different team out right and we're like you had the side effects are really temporary there's more education around them that we know exactly what to expect you so yeah at least I guess it's like a bit more information to make a decision that that's his that's right
tell me about how this whole realm of light is something that is you at the above a racetrack what health questionnaire which you share a little bit about your health history and your preferences that you have a short 5 to 10 minutes consultation with a doctor and then the doctor's advice to see if you know the options of birth control available and what might work best for you according to your healthy shrimp references and then we send the birth control to your house so easily she just a four-step process that tastes like around like 5 to 15 minutes and then the deliveries within 4 hours so it's really fast and I think it's interesting about that and how many things true that has to be in Singapore for quite a long time and
they were survivors for writing so birth control before 12 I think what we noticed is that a lot of times those boys are providing a service right and every practical Circle me in service but I think we wanted to make he's not just a pup form to access these things we need me but also where you ask questions where you get information when you were you chat we are women who are experiencing the same things right on so like I'm more so if there's an equal system for Women's Health rather than just know he is your pills that they can go back if you like my kneecap in place for the even though I've never gone to your service yet and I see that you guys are trying to create some of the differences are trained to
how to differentiate ourselves into like a physical clinic for the physical Clinic I mean other than more inconvenient I would say just because you have to usually go down to the clinic I pay for the surf trip there and back from back and you know some people might not have time off work he want to or they don't want to get a just for birth control right so I think we're making it more comfortable I think in terms of cost with having doctors and tell him anything that's a little bit more affordable making another medication also like before it was well so yeah I would say those two things anything last week just like it or I like you don't have to walk down a sexual health clinic and talk to my nice tight ass or ask for birth control right you can just get it online looking for a couch light and I think that's those really powerful for a lot of women cuz it feels like okay it's just a tiny part of my day and I doesn't come see you in like my my emotional and
do you my mental energy I can just lay by in 15 minutes and that's it right there and you know the pharmacist might be like birth control and for people who feel a little bit more more sensitive about the things it is important to have that privacy writing a story about that you guys provide sizable contractions that you provide STI what are some of the options available
come to me on what do they look for Yaz Birth Control we offer birth control pills control patches and Will Ferrell so emergency contraception so that deliver within 4 hours which means that you know you can take it as soon as he can we offer at-home STI testing so that means that you can basically take the test from home you can test for HIV infection treatment stuff like that and also menstrual health I would say that I think most people come to us for birth control on in 4 sa testing I think for the other kinds of conditions there is still quite a lot of Education to do the you know like what i shan't is there like a strange like this church looks like is it like I'm coming in like they should you look for help but I think we're still trying to create content and inform people and when they should seek help
I couldn't quite get like people just sharing their stories on Instagram the it like the end we should really appreciate it very special with me know what does it use what are their concerns and I unbelievable in the process of trying to understand that user experience I think I've mentioned I think people always bring up like sort of the inconvenience Factor you don't like how it was before and how we're so mean that you shoot the stickman Factor the affordability issues and just yeah I think it's it's just interesting to hear like and how late is hosting Michael and USA feels like this situation has continued to progress throughout the years right a dozen these kinds of issues still are a big thing I had a really memorable experiences
likely she's like last week I sign up for this like there is like 20 women and their about you some people have used this and why are people hot recommended it to friends and it was the first time that I realized I was like yeah I did that top of mine Brown Line comes to women's health and that's super powerful right cuz it means that whenever these women have a nice tree like they should say contactees and we're there for them and he fell really like just like heartwarming to know that we're making that change in and to see that it's such a mess of strangers that I've never met him my life I are aware what we're doing our super supportive so yeah super it just everything answering so far love you quite a bit as a society it's about like from finding the community like these resources right and see how they can battle it
exactly you just think you just thinking about the fact that I guess fall off my brains out there for a very long time I think like a lot of businesses would be with men in mine on my penis is Odessa seeing my dad and then a lot of times I hold things have been back at the women in the past were very capitalizing on making nephew back but I think for a lot of the new brands at who lives in front of the conversation with a human fast for you guys why is that how are you guys going to continue to live strip we are all created inside of a lot of information for four people to be able to take back control take control over their health or went and wellness desert
their bodies right I think at ease in particular we we produce a lot of medication content on social media and I think that has been super key for us right because people feel like if they're not looking for birth control to be spoiled for information idea and so I think it's it's become like said of that friend that you can always like hounds on when you have a question or is something that you need to ask advice and I think it's important that we create more of his educational spaces create more communities faces as well because they they help raise awareness they helped create conversations and I think the more we talk about what he thinks the more we might Rising on the idea of taking back control over your health body Wellness right and it's being every I think really powerful to see the effect of that like when we used to have this community is on Sundays on Instagram and we used to get like two to three hundred late response it's like Non-Stop and I mean they're not in the story says we will just reassure them in and people kept me on reacting to them
contacting with them I don't even see it that's when we realized I was there is a lot of people who want to talk about these things they just want to let you know ask questions like recipe with other people's experiences on a safe space that you don't that keeps your information private and stuff right I thought we were really curious ourselves because even though we had it so I can do a little evidence of from my friends from my workshops and stuff I got we wanted to see the larger public agreed with us or not and I remembered that you really was like two to three hundred answers and we actually run like a test of like negative words and positive words in the answers that we God and make sure they're 95% in the answers were like negative experiences and and that was really shocking to see and I think a lot of people were researching these stories as well cuz they were like well let you see creating you very important discussions in Singapore that no one's having and and yeah it was those stories were really powerful
the enemy vessel say what has your experience with the sex education mean like like like what has Siri on your menstrual health I journeyed being like stuff like that I'm getting answers from the public cool I guess my question is why do you think sexual and reproductive health is an important things in our society needs to have more positions on key says hang all the tools we need to make informed decisions about things in our life and how about our health and wellness I think it's important that we get this information to be able to decipher ourselves for a partner is like to be able to have conversations with our partners to be able to pass on that knowledge to other women who might not have access to the resources we have I think it allows us to just heal in control in houses to just heal at he's literally like just with me or what we're deciding for herself
I think that's such a powerful tool to have and I think that sexual reproductive health is part of your overall health right and I think with you the whole coffee thing happened in the past like you're so people are starting to become even more aware about their health and I think also more aware of their set of Wellness is a hole right I think it's interesting that you mention that because I think I ought to be involved in that governments have space or information about Life Women's Health it would be in a very light and it's very nice to see how different the phones spring at you for information about all the care about your sexual health is equivalent you have to be well-read about Sagittarius and you have to be accountable and not yourself
I would like to have people around you with a condom that we're putting our trying to push that idea off you know my body my choice and being able to you know make decisions for yourself right whether that is related to your health your wellness and whatever you know that choice and stuff like princess of self-care looks like for you you know we were super supportive about asking to send message over trying to convey all the materials that were putting out right like whether it's Healthcare it looks like friends birth control like for me or you don't like or no Mitchell young. Products that you might help your. Be better that I think there's so many ways that you can make choices for yourself I make you that make you feel better and make you sit up film

hi I'm Hazel Highway 80 and I'm to be welcomed by the cleverly's
Chris are you friends of family relationships you okay and this is not just you know emotional abuse and tons of toxic relationships it can also relate to physical abuse and that you may experience not just with your partner's but your friends or families and all that is fun begins what are your thoughts on this topic about toxic relationships I have I have been both on the receiving end and also been the perpetrator okay it's an invitation tips for fee I'm not proud of it but I have changed
okay I've no experience plus Indie I hope I could be the public truth I don't know if I could tell me a story of my forehead right yes yes to her friends and stuff like that for me I always like to think that I'm someone very positive and I like to think that you know I whichever it may be friendship relationship even tye's my family members I tried to keep that my all that like to mean mention I think I was on the receiving end a lot in front of me School in terms of friendship this friend who always bully me her name is r o n
or if you know someone who has been in a toxic relationship means what do you mean when you said you had it and it's something that I'm proud of him and you know when I was young I was immature I think insecurities will when it came to relationships so this boyfriend I'm with no right yeah I was with him when I was much younger and if it's not one right away so I think at that point he was my first boyfriend and I didn't really know how to do with like jealousy and I wasn't that confident in myself because of that I became very controlling I demanded to know where he was all the time if he tells me that he's leaving and 15 15 minutes late
just got here 5 minutes things like that it was really that crazy and and and and yeah I was known as the psycho girl little problem at all man everything is exactly what it supposed to go crazy reminds me of a relationship I had in secondary school one that I really treasure so no less time than using the Havana's ladies couple of people tell you I was sick I don't want it up and I got upset and you owe me a please give me some time because he has a couple thing and he didn't care for it lyrics
but you know I'm thinking about you supposed to bring home with me and I couldn't even answer that was when I knew that my gosh I was spinning out of control man salary
I am also not processed okay I'm so sorry Sean exactly is this is a legit psychology experts who tells us dr. Lillian glass key in her 1995 book saying this is any relationship between people who don't support each other where this conflict and you seek to undermine one another where there's competition this respect and a lack of cohesiveness in a toxic relationship but it's consistently and pleasanton's Bridge raining for the people in it as well and it's just filled with a lot of negativity it is it is so high this friend she was in this long-term relationship with someone from Australia and I tell you it's probably know the first two months with good because she found out I was this guy with the kitty cat for me but I saw the honeymoon period was over she realize that this guy is getting way more controlling but my friend she's not someone who is
so she takes in all of that and me looking at her I feel terrible for her the FaceTime FaceTime on when they're sleeping late in the morning when I wake up or what if we are Disconnected by your work right this is so unprofessional but we are on a cold throughout the eight hours at work cuz you couldn't deal with a long distance relationship is the money out of it I didn't realize it right
okay love you also want this kind of relationship in that relationship we were both toxic in my relationship with yourself is the difference I guess it's a difference a button right for me off of 1.0 went through that with you still here you know marry me.
if you like it then you should have put a ring on it emotionally draining and even physically damaging sometimes and these don't have to be romantic and nature it can be a professional relationship with your boss your friends or your family as well I know he's all you said that you were in a relationship but now I think I'm okay just end up my relationship with Jordan yep just some time ago and my goals know about it already I'm happy with it I think that wasn't a toxic relationship at all and the end of things on mutual terms good terms and he said yes to talk to you and checking out each other every now and then yeah and I'm I'm happy that but I wouldn't be who I am today without my past relationships without having being that toxic perpetrator to my
call spida see I wouldn't mind I would like gruel to handle such a mature relationship now but why do you feel that you are perpetrating this toxicity in my previous relationships like most people in incident and that will many other things like I wanted to know where they are what you doing whatever with but with Jordan is different you know me. We don't check out until that every hour of the day because we know for me that we are both at. With work it's mutual and we have also talked about this if either of us cheats on the other party then it came over I think having talked about this kind of issues is actually a very good way to avoid a toxic relationship because you know where the bottom line is for the both of you you know what I mean then understand is there a lot about yourself have you found yourself in a toxic relationship maybe friendship I think my friends has Rob would be difficult but maybe
see more of
a girl is experiencing a. She doesn't mean we write a very long time my life my friends have always called me or my guy friends especially the always treat me like a broiler okay okay and it wasn't recognized is Wilshire my recent feel so I was like
okay I think 7 Things I do is vent guy Behavior I think just last week my guy friend was like me home with uncles I can always tell when you're PMSing like a is near the third one is jealous when you have like coming guy friends you don't like walking on it. Let you know if I do.
much like stream but in the initial stages of their relationship right I think it was very hot for him because I'm like this right and maybe he didn't expect this it wasn't it wasn't something he was exposed to something that he was used to he couldn't understand this like concept of having this many friends having this many guy friends having to see friends quite a bit but does he have female friends. Female friends I mean don't say female a friend as a horse
I need an answer question one day he starts to hang out with his female friend that he claims it's just another friend would you be okay
I can't go in for another law
but you okay now you cool I'm okay long as you yourself also have your own friends and stuff without me excuse me
the tables have turned relationship newborn potties trust each other a lot and I think this is what it takes for a relationship to work each door did you think like when you're younger you tend to be a bit more irrational and when you're older you like I should have nothing to worry about Lee fine on my own
anybody in the relationship expects things in the workplace or even in family
you that I'm quite at someone's I feel like I'm not feeling because I don't like to tell my parents what's going on with my work especially if they are negative experiences because I don't want them to worry because I think my parents are very traditional so anytime I tell them something the first thing you would do is to find the problem is the problem in the in the things that I tell them and they scold me for it to tell you cuz I thought was funny to share with you exactly which means that the salt that she consumed is more than the right at 8 because she's leaving like longer longer than I ever have been right
anyways she would always want me to listen to her when I broke up with your boyfriend I know my mom this is what is the first time I can I talk to you about something and she said she listened to me and basically she's supposed to give me a list of light steps that I can fix it really doesn't work this way for my own good she will because you want me to follow her but I do think that this is a bit toxic though I feel me let me know cuz I know she means well but could have been a bit different because I think as children we just want them to hear us out you know given that it comfort you been out looking for like at parental relationship but in Asia family
I'm having somebody else we want to give out kids like these of steps that they can follow for their own good you know we don't want you probably want me to solve it for you why I think a lot of times we just want people to listen right yeah that deals are red something right where this person was like saying that in my family When someone tells us that problem the first thing we say is do you just want to listen or do you want us to do something
that makes sense
"TD Bank Crystal Soldier can you give me the price of relationships and friendships as well as part of a group that employee we were very big friend group and I love every one of them to death but I think at that point we were very cool dependent okay like never see each other, if you like when a diet that kind of in that sense of humor a bit toxic because everyone was in everyone else's business and if one bus and I we didn't like what one person was doing we felt like we had the authority to call them out on it as though we are like since you can't mean it happens to everyone because of that if you find yourself in a very codependent kind of like big friend group right maybe it's time to take a step back and see if he is there's some growing you could do outside of it because my I had left at"
when I broke up with my ex and I realized it actually in terms of my emotional growth was stunted when I stayed there because you know that people at that point of time in your life but you were older than that point from a man on Earth but myself having it written about his toxic relationship you know being a bit jealous okay and she obviously had some mental health issues as well and every time he would want to break up with her she would threaten suicide so of course it's never good and obviously it's never dependent on your partner to fix you if you are broken you need to go and fix yourself so what happened with that
they obviously are having sex and all that she always insisted on not using a condom he always insisted on using one eventually they compromised on the pull out method which is not 100% effective then she tested positive that she was pregnant but when she didn't keep it but because of all this right I think he realized that he had to initiate The Break-Up my can't really go through with it I think being away from his friends and family and not having that support system and kind of like being controlled every aspect of your life and kind of like the pregnancy to manipulate him into staying so I think this is more common than we actually think it's sad that people don't talk about it and it's something that I guess in our society
Habbo Pisces to talk about Ray and that's why we are telling you about it here today so question did you think that they knew that they were both in the Tulsa area Nation ship because sometimes people just don't see that you know in Chinese I want you to be his people being involved in the situations they are blind and what they tell you when I realized that my relationship bus 370 but I did not change it I just talked to him last night about it actually is so much easier to be in a relationship when I'm not so insecure and stuff like that and he said yeah I like the last three years have been heaven for me compared to what was before that but when I realized that I'm taking things too far okay we wouldn't depend on the holiday right and I used to have this problem where
I get right in my head about it I need to check my part in this phone if I don't write what if I make up in my head is worse than what I actually would see okay but I don't trust him it's not that I think he's going to do something it's just my hidden manifest Esau in the Hotel this was like maybe 7 a.m. and I decided okay I'm going to look he's asleep and I looked and I looked and I looked in a single thing I went to his Instagram
on his explore picture I saw a picture of his ex exploitation if he doesn't follow it just popped up on the algorithm like crying I went hysterical and he woke up he was like
and after that whole debacle I realize shit I really went too far as like I need to work on myself correct yeah like I said before you can carry only relationships I don't know why I think I have done this as well. I have checked my part in this phone and I never try to do I didn't see anyting but well what I did see though was that he was talking to one of his female colleague okay and the content that they talk about we make me realize how much she's not telling me I mean in terms of work like these things that you tell you give me a call I would have loved to know as a girlfriend so because of that I got a bit sensitive I got a bit like
you know is this our relationship falling apart and sit at that you shouldn't do it an even as your partner you let you know you don't trust me right now but to see that and then realize that this is not something I don't know I would be affected because I feel like in a relationship or marriage right your partner should be your best friend if a man's best friend is not the wife and it's another girl I don't trust it I'm sorry because population should we were already talking less and less right and and I see this chat you're telling you if you may call it so much and they're like this it goes together in office that I know that I was just a bit of fact that I don't think that this is my problem instead of his that I could have talked to him without checking his phone and maybe the solution would be even clearer and better for both of us
"starting a video of a computer lady by checking app on this phone you have to realize that this is actually trying to feel in your heart which I think can never be done you need to really work on yourself has identified why are you feeling this insecurity is it because of your past, is it because you have trust issues from somebody went through last night no one else can fix it for you but I also wanted to share Another Story theme wanting to test a fuse in it okay so this is from a story about Africa and actually saw some old Facebook messages that she sent to a previous lover but her boyfriend actually flew into a jealous rage and threatened her with a knife and this is not her full name lucky she was actually on Fremont"
pregnant at the time and he said I will make sure I end your life
that someone that someone who needs help jealousy we can make people do crazy things I do believe that even before they have gotten to this point there must have been some great flight I forgot and her partner chose not to see you know what I mean in yourself and that you like trusting other people because you feel like you are not enough so somehow you want to go at night find something you know exactly so this is how I felt when I check his phone I'm so sorry. And I just had to see for yourself by everybody will change your change okay so she has some signs okay number one that's a whole lot of drama number to everything is about them your Pony friends
number three they constantly put you down okay they compete with you I won't talk about healthy competition that but if they are in a completely different field they want something to do and bring you download edit desktop healthy it'll live they secretly copy you how much does that mean they really want achieve what you have that's why they try to follow whatever you have done the same results but I was Confident Woman to point it out right away all the friends are you even having friends that she said you feel responsible for them that he will critical they lie to get sympathy or to get what they want and last but not least you feel that something is wrong
feeling you do if you are listening to this and you identify like some of these things in your relationship not seeing that always about relationship breakup we're not saying that you're saying you need to maybe identify the perpetrator here in the right one of you is it one of you and how can you actually work on yourself to stop these signs I think you like if you have a question yourself like is it really supposed to be this hot chances of the answer is no and you you can come over excuse is so you know make up excuses to Apostle of actions as this is dead but this is what I think is the energy if you're always feeling like it's an endless fight and endless battle and it just feels like super up here right and because you have nothing else to compare it to so you think I owe me being supposed to be this hot I really should not be so hot in this together
Jimmy mentioned just now I'll see if you less insecure about yourself actually became so much is it worth with right you don't question what is doing at every hour of the day you don't you come back happy to share your experiences of whatever happened in Italy with one another I think it's a good feeling about my roommates and stuff with you for your money. No more money kid can actually make you stay with me and I'm very thankful that he was there with me for those years because you know I had stuff going on at home as well and that really affected my mental health but he was there not for just me but for my entire family he was mediating stuff on my thighs and someone who's not going to marry into the family but I don't know why she's really an angel that I really think he's an angel sent down to like for that money in his Austin ASAP before as well he can you pick Jamie up and give me a lift
I have to say he's a very nice guy that even to Jimmy's friends he's so genuine in the backseat with me is not the PLC DJ stand
the refreshing
but I will tell you exactly a relationship immediately and that is when it comes to abuse physical abuse especially violence really think you need to leave you guys know if anyone that you know possibly was in an abusive physically abusive relationship like somebody I don't know that but I've heard the stories when we do donation drives okay on the station so we have donation drives with the organisation will come forward and get us to set up light em up and get donations for them and a lot of times they will have a couple of profiles or like the beneficiary slight that we can
speak to and I was talking to a few and that's when I heard stories like this so I think one in particular last year it was his mother of four and I think the kids were very young like primary school and blue twins also and then I think the story was that her ex-husband used to abuse her like physically and in front of the kids a hug traumatizing that must have been for the kids and I guess when you're married you got kids or if it's a family situation is so difficult for you to leave like your boyfriend girlfriend if you get to see you got to get out what is there so many things I please your how can you just walk away imagine is your parents right here for you you know what that feed you and you see the same hands on punching your mother
yeah I think it's pretty tough especially when your parents are the one who puppetry toxic behaviour abusive Behavior I think there's some at home to his parents are very mentally toxic his father's a month at gaslights controls threatens his every movement the month money all the time and his mother basically treats him as an emotional punching bag he's the one that she picks it up on and he feels going home it's really that bad he feels going home he hate being in the house his parents will break his looks like you're ugly. You're fat you're you know whatever is yet let your terrible you're a terrible person and this kind of like verbal abuse over the years and from some people that you love and respect right it can really put you in a dark place so much so that this guy considered suicide
but you need to seek out I think there is you do a proper way that you can look for help and not just continue to stay in this abusive situation I think this is happening more often than we think but because physical abuse is also a vampire say topic to talk about maybe some of our friends are experiencing it. They would never tell us about it I mentioned in season 1 of the great school friend used to constantly tell her that you don't fit you didn't fat lose weight so much so that she became so what's really have a lot of power in them
I think it's easier to see especially when it's not happening to you or I just want to say it anyway because I hope someone out there so they can just find it in them to understand that like the situation right now by the way it is it's really 10% and how you react is 90% so whatever the situation is Right could really be the worst but I think you have it in you to not let it affect you this way we'll see it and if you are maybe I am the one you don't accidentally done something that made it caused her to the other party and this made you realize that and well I mean you just know that things do get better and then why I'm so proud of the little progress to ask me ever since I was I was young and I don't have
time to be insecure anymore to be honest I barely have time to think about myself in these days so it comes to the beach but if you do need proper advice you do need proper help on the Singapore Ministry of Social and family development msft have launched a 24-hour National helpline it's called the national anti-violence helpline for reporting Family Violence in other cases of abuse neglect and it's Singapore's first such National initiative dedicated to calls related abuse and violence and the helpline also operates primarily in English or with mandarin Lee and tamil-speaking professionals available if needed the number for the national Auntie Violet outline is one 800-777-0000
it sounds like a TV commercial right now
okay this is not a sponsor podcast we had to say we need to share this with you because this is a readily available free help line toll-free that you can actually go to and find find someone you know that you trust perhaps to to go through this with you and obviously don't call it if you're in that abusive situation and you know that you will invite more abuse by calling the hotline go to a safe place maybe a friend's place or something like that so I just want a quick sorry okay sorry about toxic relationships and I think in this one it's because it's really tired Viola it was really fun and fire so this is a friend of mine and they were very toxic for each other okay
she was insecure he fell into her insecurities okay so at that point maybe they were in a relationship like when a Javier said he's my friend and be with studying where's your main was steady and then because I had a lot of other friends there so they they knew him as well but I don't interact with him right and then one day one of these friends sit to me okay be safe that it's an open relationship
when I say Okay and she flew off the handle it was a committed relationship that was how their relationship was easy because I came back to this insecurities where he he was not as committed as she wants him to be loved and she is very insecure supposed me see she saw the peak of the story is
one year at the end of the year I remember with me a Christmas I spent almost every day with her cuz she was crying every single day and what happened was this guy had decided to go on a trip with his friends and told her two days before he left and right so and he was gay so he said like oh this is where we're going this is who I'm going with two other guys and I'll be back for Christmas okay and so that means the trip was going to be like one week free sample okay have you a ticket know I've only got one way ticket why it doesn't make sense right okay so come Christmas some big drama happen basically like she can pick up his phone he just am I 8 she's going crazy here right
so he didn't come back okay because the initial plan now that we know the story he was going to be away for a month
and she just didn't want to tell her don't happen like twice or Thrice on that trip that he just kept pretending that he was coming back but he was coming but why did you even bother to put out a soul to tell her that you're coming back you will supply issues
do that thing and she was just crying she was terrible right and at some point I remember I think I came back something happen and she's the kind something happen must go and find him straight away no matter because a time that lets you know she went down right away to see my space and she didn't want to do with it now so he just came down for a bit sore for a bit and then sitting I need to work tomorrow just go home and she was still there I thought it was a bit as well. But he went up and asked my dad to come down and do it for them
I'm pretty sure just guess the night that same night she actually goes to the hospital
like a meltdown I can't okay
but you see I think in this short story that has been sitting right there are already a lot of red flags that I could identify but maybe not for go a who has been in this situation like this whole time because what is it love is blind right that's why sometimes right it's not about the people in the relationship realizing that hey this is abusive perhaps it takes someone else a family member or friend or even a neighbor if you feel like your neighbor right going crazy hitting each other and you know it's getting abusive things maybe you should also consider calling the hotline some some parent is a donkey donkey poo I think when the time comes for you to take action we should be the one doing this right okay so is girls you hear what sounds like beating and adults something and children crying from your neighbor's house what should you do
one 800-777-0000 and it tells you about abuse that he received from the husband or the wife what do you do
email at 8:30. Violence is never the answer but I think what was kind of like a like a heavy topic but it's something a lot of people experience I think being in a toxic relationship but I know you're on the receiving end of the the giving and it's always learning cuff you know you can always step out of it it says this whole situation and think about how you can make yourself a better person and don't put yourself down if you have been bullied before or if you have been abused but really think about how we can make other people's lives and your life better from now onwards I think that if you're listening and you can for no relationship is perfect nobody since it will be perfect and it can be difficult you know for for a couple of years and I think a lot of a lot of Singapore in couples experience days where you know they go out to work and then the boy
inbox for delayed in the government's I ate but you should spend more time with me I know people that are going through this and because I went through it right I told him it will get better you just need to communicate with each other and understanding we call each other out on these things and and make a conscious effort to change and it will not always be this bad even if it's with your family with your friends you just need to try your best to communicate but when it comes to a physically abusive Point our best advice would be to remove yourself from the situation there's no excuse that can be made up for it other than that I feel like if it's that say it's bubble right let's see it's bubble and it's a situation that you can easily remove yourself from I feel like for the vault don't let whatever people say get you down because
you know maybe everybody's working on being more confident and you know being better versions of themselves but once you allow these Woods to get to your head right that's when it really messes you up you know and I know for a lot of people as well especially Vision parents since I was growing up they say things in the angry yes and they forget but kids doing and they hold on to that yeah but I feel it at the end of the day it's on you to not allow somebody else to do this to you they will always be people try to hurt you give me the exact you need to get your stuff but you must not let that for you because you must I think it's harder to do it that's like saying you don't but I hope you can just like talking to yourself and just tell yourself that you do but like School of you at the end of the day if I'm starving and I'm going to feed me I'm not answerable to you I lead my own life and hence I will believe that on the bus I can do this I will not listen to what you said or lights at law
amazing and you know none of us here at hunt a perfect we all on our own journey to try to improve when I was twelve then it's a lifelong journey right so thank you for being with us if you would like to share please feel free to do so yet he can loan me feel like an old friend hello actress clarity.com so once again thank you so much for listening and Hazel on the next episode of Gravity
I'm going to show you a picture of Lady Gaga's a show it to me that it took was blue eyes Hazel Highway 80
I bet even 6112 I hope you get this today is the last episode of season 2 of Hershberger the comments you know and I was supposed to meet them just lying about something a bit hairy body hair facial hair on women okay okay so I think like in recent years right body
positivity has become such a huge thing and people are starting to embrace different body types body sizes but body hair is still one thing that has yet to catch up when you think can we just do a quick poll on whether or not you can accept body hair on the count of three peat okay down there
lakes lakes in 321 know I have to say stuff like something they can poke you like today I'm wearing shorts I think in terms of like Anthony Coqui right I hadn't have any hair on my arms on my lucky huh you know they say right yes she usually wears jeans is she's in jeans today right she really shave her legs okay
very very worried about it she went to what sense to buy a shaver and she did the public toilet
I totally agree but why do you think right women feel so pressured to shave why is this is just not attractive I think it's also for Hygiene purposes when you perspire When you sweat your underarms is going to trip all the sweat all the germs and it's going to smell an idea I thought it'd be good to kind of like cool back to the beginning of time when they were in the world
"actually keep men keep women when did actually become a beauty said that you have to be like a naked mole rat in the 20th century, but it was more of like a keeping your body clean it was not for aesthetic purposes in the day the Roman Empire the time when it became really like an aesthetic thing it was like maybe 18 19 hundreds that is when it became part of the beauty routine and it was a mockery of femininity and class so if you got buddy hair you are no class but we all going buddy have a lot of other places to eat differently like for example at some point in time Yuna brows in the Middle East was considered a tractor sexy"
fashion trends begin to change my shorts and stuff like that because of that I think head removal became very big especially in the US and you see all these airbrush them models and stuff like that and also because of the popularity of waxing pornography explicit pop culture ponography is a huge cost a thing that going Hellas is right we can I just say I saw I saw at least 60 off to American influences okay and all the comments were just people asking how did she say so clean
that was a question how did she say so clean I P L people
descend with like having hair safely in recent years there has been like this rise of embracing your body hair I'm going to show you a picture of Lady Gaga a show it to me he died it took was blue blue oh my God I don't know it's for you I think Lady Gaga's out to make a statement but this statement is not sitting well with me more hair on their own
stayyjealous
I think it's it's it's it's interesting like I accept all body types I embrace all body types of a lot of young gen Z created like to show off their body hair. And then she say something that you breathe and then I always love to look at the comments that always blaming her for a bit and I don't know I think it's possible toys little taste and preference
but I can't I'm sorry I am not because it's a personal choice you would respect someone else's choice to have a big head that is right right that's why I wouldn't comment anything nasty I wouldn't like to happy go ahead but I think a lot of women celebrate going on at your house and having body hair you don't think they like what hair is natural you know it's my choice to have it I want to make a statement about beauty Standish right it makes me feel beautiful and strong grow or we move your body have a shaving seeing lasering it is entirely up to you they are all valid option in many countries actually it's a normal for that right right window country I would not even bother saving
but yes so let's not bring you know each other doubt I think it's females we really should Impala each other no matter what they choose to do with their body it's my body my choice your body your choice

how do you say Bill it says there a Humane and welcome back to another episode of cavities
we are back on the set but we have reset today because I was irritated he is in a screen I am devastated that usually she's on my ride together. Times I think we're doing all that we can to keep each other safe as a vessel this won't be for long but I'm worried about something that we had publicly dressed up for you can buy you a drink but today we're talking about babies and more specifically something called social egg freezing and this episode was a lot more than just that we're also going to talk about the notion of having a biological clock as females right so very briefly to the floor yes or no are you concerned about having a ticking biological clock hazy what do you think
cuz you used to be my dream to be married by sadek 28 by 28 29 East but it clearly isn't happening and I actually had the same thought as well lie in my notes that I wrote kids by 26 but I am 26 this year so it's definitely not concerned because I always hear the notion that younger is better to have kids all my friends that have kids they told me a lie but when you're younger is smooth ER with less complications so I would say yes but we can't do it if it more later what about you yes or no I think I'm a little less concerned to be honest because I'm a bit more like it happens it happens can kennel you don't like but I think it's pressure from people as well telling you like things like oh you should try to have your first kid before 30 the body is different after 30
"that kind of things I think it scares me a little bit yeah I see it's okay let's set the stage you are right for those that don't know actually I learned a lot reading the notes for today session a woman with a finite number of eggs okay so it continuously the Beats over time and where are you most fertile now and in late 20s early 30s right after which the quality of your egg actually decreases and the possibility of happy children it does get a bit hotter a bit more complicated as well but I don't think it has to be this way so too damn hot spot, let's talk about fertility social egg freezing and how this actually affects our family our life and our career"
okay. Why are we concerned or not cuz you know about our taking a biological clock hazy you know what I used to have some friends older than me and she might be trying to conceive at the age of 37 38 and they had such a hard time looking at them I don't want to go through that you know what I mean as much as I respect them for for trying so hard and you know the one you want to have a kid the more distressing and the more they are not able to conceive and images of cycle and so many problems that come with giving birth above the age of 35 I think they're many veteran actresses in the industry as well then talk about this. I think she is one of them she has so many times about how difficult it is to
this is worrying for me because right now I don't even have a partner and get married and spend some time together just the both of us before we try for kids and Biden how old would I be even after my second one like how old would I be that's why I think this is a busy but you have a long line of suitors as we always say I know you're waiting for Tom Holland I don't know why you think you can find
"Google tell me how long should I wait no problems I freeze my eggs and I actually agree with the same thing where she was saying you know love but that doesn't come unlock people in the public eye and they actually have kids much later than how you traditionally would I feel like that normalizes it for me as well and I think what's so wrong about that I was younger I used to think like oh you got to have kids before like 35 to kind of think you and then now you see people around you having kids at like 37380 then you start thinking it's possible, but I think sometimes it makes you forget that you know it's more risky it's hot as well so I think we got a lot to unpack today you have my own mom actually had me when she was in her thirties that I didn't feel like a pressure in my twenties I have to that's what I wanted for my future"
is not happening with Let It Go
but what about user on in terms of whether you consider it having children before the age of 30 I mean you're married but do you think so.
I can read Teddy 5 so that would have left me in plenty of time by right right I mean I guess I don't know if people expected me to have kids quite immediately or anything like that but it ain't happening and initially honestly at that point I thought okay maybe two years I'm at 2 years now I'm going okay maybe another two yeah but I think it's a concern as well because let's see I want the option of having more than one and if not say I want to read and I don't want to have their accession right so I wouldn't want to space it out maybe two or three assignments at 9 yesterday and bad thing for 3 and if I let say now I'm not ready and I said that the I'll be starting 9 when I'm not trying to have my last kid will I still be able to at that point I don't know what it feels like what if I want to work that way right and then means I have to start now I'm not Regina that's a reality for a lot of people and I think that
with you no more technology coming in to help us we might not have a few this Porsche but let's unpack this pressure first and foremost right where do you guys think this comes from his see what do you think being in Asia being a country like Singapore maybe if you have traditional parents you know they would always want us to do because they think is easier for us and in a fit and healthy so I think this is where the treasure is coming from I'm from society is not so much not as high as the pressure coming from the family what are you going to think what I think I'm a producer actually put in a really good note that this really stems from how a woman self-worth is tacked to her marital status and it's traditionally been a patriarchal society where people used to say when you're younger in the past I guess and it's more of a social conditioning that we feel this pressure but is it
maybe something that we have to face in our lifetime. I feel like I can't because my mom had me sign a late as well she gave me when she was 33 so growing up everybody's mothers were younger and people with because my friends will the older right so my older friends had moms around the same age as mine and so I always thought oh okay so she had me a bit late though but you know maybe the norm is said you haven't a bit earlier so I grew up thinking or maybe I should has Mike it's a bit earlier than I have more time that kind of thing but right now I'm in a place where you talked about how other people would view that decision is not real like like relatives and stuff like that help Society with judge you I think that when it comes to freezing of eggs are a lot of people think so if a woman wants to freeze her eggs
she wants to focus on my career but there are so many reasons why you would want to feed your ex and it's not just that and it hurts let her do what she wants to go I mean you can choose your eggs like scrambled you have that choice we could have that choice to study online is very similar to Hazel's reason for why she thinks that you know what she might have kids needs in life it's because they have no partner at this point of time is not just about Korea majority of women said I don't have someone right now we want to make sure that when we find the house right is the one who is responsible committed to this relationship but I think one of the members of all Clementine brought up a good point
opposing side right we have a producer who is pregnant now
but she actually said I was very concerned until I got pregnant and I found all the complications that could happen if you have kids when you're older which makes sense do I remember my friend having a kid maybe lost it when she was about late thirties or something and she has had other kids before that when she was younger so I remember that when you're pregnant at that sort of each they make you go through more tests more like blood tests and things like that are more check-ups is well because I think that's a lot of worries surrounding it and they always emphasized that the kids will always say like it's a higher risk the small complications to it that's a high-risk to Down syndrome as well and things like that so they're always very worried the doctors and hence I think that's the kind of things that you might have to deal with expecting it at a later age
you know what she didn't she marry a Singaporean possibilities for 142 days that you couldn't leave a bit and she received more than 300 injections to conceive a baby that's the thing is that this whole concept of having kids as well all right I mean it's really what is best for you and we haven't talked with said I'm not really concerned because at the moment I have different priorities if I can have babies in the future I'll just have a few more doggos
freezing right this is something that is very common in a lot of countries but it's actually banned in Singapore from what I understand you need to have a certain Adeline medical condition or valid reason to even get X-rays I think there are a lot of different stakeholders in this but it's currently bed and only available to those with medical needs such as those who have to undergo chemotherapy because it will affect their fertility right now they're a lot to freeze it before they go through chemo and stuff like that but because it's not available to like healthy women with no valid reason a lot of Singapore it's expensive the so much additional costs involved in all that but you can also think of it in the big picture as a nation were trying to push our fertility rate birth rate higher
think that maybe with allowing it to happen it freezing that might eat in the fatality rate going up because if I don't want to now that's a people like hazel for example you know she's 27 she needs time to find somebody she needs time to decide if he's the one if he's not the one it's just a fight somebody else it's a couple more years and she wants kids but if this option is not available to her it's going to make it harder for her since she was a contribution to the number of like example but you know how many kids do you want to contribute to the birth rate in Singapore last year that showed that he was intent than women
okay so it's more like a precautionary and you know you have insurance like they always say right now put all your eggs in one basket and it's really warm us are your ovaries a bit more about the Landscaping Singapore on surrounding egg freezing okay I think one of the Ministries is afraid that it could lead to women delaying marriage because let's see you know that you have insurance policy Zion then let me focus on other things at this moment but I think you need to think of the flip side as well but if they are not ready is that you fought and they have kids and that's why have you not heard of cuz I have had like personal stories from people I know who
I'm not saying that they settled but where they hit a certain point in their life and they feel the need to rush even though they're not a hundred percent sure of the person but they feel the need to let you know what he's going to be it's not fantastic but it's not bad and I'm running out of time this year in February and July there were a lot of stakeholders trying to raise this issue in Parliament to kind of rethink its policy on social egg freezing missed Chumlee weigh from Tampines DRC actually argued that under the existing circumstances right women had to go overseas and they have to your better risk bear the costs of doing that why not have it here where our medical technology is so Advanced and yeah I think we're okay the organisation I think they have released a statement I'm trying to adjust a government to reconsider this because the notion of it on the basis of it is that they should be given a choice that woman
be given a choice with what they want to do the eggs so I think the government is as I expected but goes when you think do you think you want exceeding to be legal again Singapore for all women I think it would be an option I would consider and I do think that maybe we should really look into this because at the end of the day with a lot of things right you know thinks like control over your body and things like that you should have that yeah this is part of your body in your life as well and I do understand that maybe you know they don't want people to delay marriage if you know that you have that back up the insurance you would take your time but I think it could the reverse could happen as well yeah because people might want kids does not now and you give them this option you will your number for a Riesling maybe not now but maybe later
for me I feel like I might I might consider it maybe not for like now but for my late the children if I supposed to have them and I'm a bit older the only children and their children's children what about you would you open you up a 90% of women I think what could have happened has happened to be that you don't they but they ended up getting pregnant the natural way this could be like a precautionary measure kind of thing I don't feel like it's helpful for women to have this option but you don't Indian if you and I'm not using the a that you posed is actually good for you as well I think this opens up a lot more. And I think I would prefer for that to be legal in Singapore
I want my eggs frozen II haven't thought about that in video yet but it could be a good opportunity all like a good kind of time breathing for many women out there I hear you I hear you I think personally for me I'm not in a rush and I am not considering egg freezing right now because I feel like as much as possible I want to conceive naturally it was the only reason why I would in a few years is because of his soul might my Titi actually told me right the health of the baby is dependent on the health of you do the egg and sperm and the time of conception not at the time of birth so that just means that if my eggs are healthier now mostly I be a very healthy lifestyle alive but if they're slightly healthy and no then it would give the baby the best fighting chance yet so don't be the main reason but right now I don't think I would if it were available and I don't think I would go and freeze my eggs maybe when I'm 30 but I think there are a lot of reasons why people would not want to
steaks fries mostly there's a lot of Macy's out there that would kind of Judge opinion as much as we want to see why do we leave when the inclusive Society right sorry I don't understand why you freeze your eggs and do you know cuz he's not really why don't you just you know do it the normal way that I do
"if you conceive a child to a frozen English peas supposed to be a body or even system is weaker and all that and I don't think this nice I roam completely so to speak and I think it's a very expensive procedure or just across the border in Malaysia it costs $5,000 to get a procedure done and the storage fees are $1,000 a year and I just ran a locker"
you got free level Malaysia in Australia it cost 11000 Singapore dollars for the procedure alone
all right okay so that means right that whether you freeze your eggs or not that
conceiving at a later age is still a problem whether you freeze your eggs or not you still have to try and you don't conceive as early as possible right so those people that sing or it will delay them having can we delete fall right on both sides but I do want to bring up an organisation I'm not going to need them but they have said that performing these procedures it freezing on healthy people is ethically questionable there are religious organization but then they also along with it freezing abortion also cannot Aesthetic Surgery of plastic surgery also cannot because you're healthy out why you need to go in through your nose all under the same category
he thinks it's frozen and is ultimately your choice you know if you have some sort of concern of yours whether it's Korean or whatever the reason is right for you to delay having children I don't think the reason it's a problem so you know them saying that's a selfish I worry about is I don't need a reason the problem because if you look at it that means that these people this woman they know the weight of having a child and they probably want to be as ready as possible as stable as possible emotionally mentally maybe financially before they raise a child which means that they don't have gravity of it as competitive diving hidden do it all like having a kid to save your marriage which one and I think that that is one of the
I would say one of the positive argument of social egg freezing and I also read online that by having this while but having this insurance policy write your whole approach the family building is different because you go in without that pressure off my all my time is running out yeah then you go in with like I really want to open my heart over my mind and find someone that's right for me and we'll stick it through me and you're not like settling like what is there a set of you on his phone so those are some of the you know I would say benefits yeah yeah on the positive side is Benjamin lifted in Singapore I've always been of the opinion that is your body a choice and I was very very awesome very disappointed to find out that in Texas this is great news recently they just banned abortion 16 weeks and up most women don't even know that they're pregnant at 6 weeks because that's just who weeks from your last. It doesn't make sense if I owe you a crazy story a friend of mine when you found out she was pregnant
7 months into it
7 months she gained a lot a lot of what we see stories where they like to have a stomach ache right now.
"Does not does not fight but you know what reverses the argument that at 6 weeks yeah there's no way so that's very disappointing and I'm very thankful that in Singapore abortion is legal but for this I think we could take it a step further and lift the bed but he see what do you feel today. I think from a okay if I think of it from Me, Senpai in or you know what this nation building and things like that I do feel like maybe they're looking at it from a sin point where they want things more instant where they want things more or less risky and like oh just eliminate the option and you won't have to do all of that problem understandable but I do feel like maybe opening of your options at the individual would bring your bow"
if it's in future encourage more people to do you know exactly how you might feel a bit more option of keeping the eggs first we talkin about it is very important and not making it such a taboo taboo thing with my mom when I get home like my eggs what will you do
I never thought of it from Oceanside the point of view but I never understood right because it's always been all my life my choice my body my choice and I do feel like that should be how it is well yes I never really thought about all those people say I should call it quite bizarre that people you know have negative perceptions of it so that I can almost immediately picture her thing know why on cuz this is not the conventional way of people is not the conventional way of doing things and then traditional Asian parents it is not conventional and unconventional then don't go for it because people will judge you for it I mean this is what Society thinks I'm supposing
I think she might be disapproving but if given the chance I'll do rationally she might understand as well I think this is linked to the bigger picture with women only good for but I think it's good for us. You don't live so much other things in your life and there are tons of women that don't want to have kids this has nothing to do with it at all I think this is one thing that I am reminded off which is people are afraid of what they don't understand so maybe maybe this is exactly like maybe IVF 20 years ago where people didn't understand what was going on do afraid of it they would just stay away from it but because it's become a norm now Society even encourages it so maybe you don't waste time to go to understand that action is nothing wrong with it but it might even bring benefits it just if anything at all it's just a security blanket the opens up your options though so that shouldn't be negative connotations attached to it maybe we need time
I have a friend who can see by your IDs and they've been talking about it right until the kid was born the kid is maybe like 34 years old at least you can you please go talk about like how my kid was conceived in front of him because I don't want him to feel like he's weird about it because she's afraid of what the what method do you know I think it's so great a lot of your mom influences are sharing open about that Journey that I conceived through IVF let me tell you about the difficulties the benefits and all that it normalizes it and tells younger females as well and don't beat yourself up
I need these that your ass out and you're done it's actually very similar to IVF you going to get home on injection they put you asleep and then extrapolate from you is not an easy process at all which means that if you committed to that it's it's a commitment that you wish you well of it by the pressure to be the ideal woman and their relatives imposing expectations of them what would you advise them be I would say you don't have to tell that your parents or parent than all your friends about your decisions because they are yours so just do whatever makes you comfortable and just keep quiet about it. I do feel that you don't owe anyone an explanation yeah I am and I have always been on that camp you
want to do you do you own it I think and the other day you should understand that your choices have consequences if you're okay or the consequence do you know and I don't think anybody's opinion to affect absolutely and to Ronald this episode I have some great comebacks for you if anyone asks you about having kids when are when are you having kids after I see I'm still practicing

3 to 12
hello hazel Hyatt is 0 Eastern Maine and this is us on series of harsh podcast
3321 Azalea okay 3 2 1
I need a really long one lawsuit like the one I used to put a pantyliner on top of pet to prevent leakage right yeah that's what's so go try that for me I would use it with my tampon just like me
I think that the bravest people are the people that wear white on there. I think Olivia is like pretty panties like you know the stuff in the tightest stuff like the white and stuff is on my. OK Google waterproof kind of like they haven't gone to that Charlotte
okay let's catch it
Juanita what is this
give me a b b l e
i really caught life we go okay.
we are going to be reviewing Ben C. Penney's thing this is nicer than my regular reviewing all different kinds you know from the big to the small tooth into the thick and they're all inside this beautiful pet care just saying this is that the fault as well for sustainability because with pets in Temple but you do get over you got to wait on feelings like the we we will talk about the things one just now so let's take a look
been thinking about it but I've been sitting on it so this is great I actually really like this and let's see the other one is so many things and see if they have every different kind of songs regular panties all the way up to a regular okay 310 points worth
just like a couple of differently is they can feel it's Leah and there seems to be a waterproof layer inside should be the pathway protects and it exalts rid of the odor that you know you might experience right yeah okay okay okay but this apart better protection
haven't touched both right yes compared to the other one doesn't feel sicker if you see any boot pet in the locker but the the material I think gives me less confident because it's bamboo Merino wool and microfiber. It's a black one and skin color and it's too full 1990
laundry icons and Lace trim by the sites you okay with that we've mentioned earlier right they're all online bass right right this one because everywhere I'm walking and get your period panties accessible in the stairs and if you think about the long run on 1990 S10 2 compared to the price of pets products out right now you have to take a look at this is so similar
chocolate okay so what we going to do now is like a leak test okay and we three of different absorbency obviously this is the license and we have got this some concoction here to Spoons old door lights and that's when we feel it coming out and it's actually very much so that it can have a regular Temple wow so why did one in ankle and then you put it here and then we'll see how fast it like an adult or does it like rolled out
Google
hey buddy
maybe it's like when you have pressure okay I tried
okay okay now I can see why because After exiting some pressure on it right it can we just do a test where you put a lot can we same same for her eyebrows at Everest
I just feel yo yo yo yo yo
what do you do
we can see that you know it's not
is one Lola by still going in right this one okay
yeah it's sort of like something that is uncomfortable maybe because it's fake
no I'm very honestly I'm not the consistency of this is a little bit different from my actual. But so that's a bit of light discrepancies ever after it is completely dry on this site
it's clear how come my tongue is red what color are using fake blood was yellow kid the Knicks won this is the 68th one so this is the one that is starts like halfway and then it goes all the way through the Bible with the same I hope that I don't see him again.
okay this one off from fussing personality it doesn't go in like that things like that we just tried it be like what it's supposed to be behind from the outside so you can see it is still completely clean but then the site has a bit of a dangerous dangerous okay okay so should I put the leak proof to the test okay
I said I don't know where that's why I said I'm just going to keep going
buffoon sitting at Wawa and fixing to hang out humans are doing that this is fake blood may be real blood pressure when you actually are on your.
okay so we wettest in 321 no
right now I have a lot of faith in this put out because it feels like a bike shorts with a pendant for cycling
lightning
why is going in really slow down a screen
actually out of the three I think this is the most absorbent one but it's like that yes that's true that is it time already well sometimes we do what are you saying
Albertson India OK Google
does it come through as other fingers I'm just curious
show me see if it came out on the other side okay okay k
I have one more for good measure
okay you don't have to have when I'm only slightly damp it feels like it is comfortable in 321 okay maybe you can bring me some cuz you were the one that wanted to try remember who we're trying I will have to be like really the last day of my. Okay so we've had a lot of fun until this really every single time
well I think I'm definitely open to trying it but I would definitely also just for the first few times to get myself a bit more comfortable with the idea of where your panties how are you I think before this right because of the reviews I've heard from friends who I really was expecting it to be like magic you know that it absorbs right away yeah so I was a bit taken aback but maybe also because that was stink slide right so I am looking forward to testing it out for myself I would love to be able to switch cuz like he looked at you think that might have been right in the long-term sustainability I think this is the way so hopefully it we all going to be something that yeah we can recommend to you all right once again thank you so much for watching this first episode of

wine pairing with tell you something and other parent with who's going to get him no no no no no but he's a good guy everybody
how did you feel when you found out I was told about your parents divorce were you told me I was not enough I believe I came I saw his opposite of snooping on my sisters and you could feel like a fellow tension I was twelve going to that was a big change and then there's this big change and you can't do anything that's been helping us so we just listen in even so we couldn't understand and all romantic relationships
it's been quite a while but I saw still has it done and I think I found your future if they'll just enjoying the light that's just be useful and let you know you were into it thinking you and everything in this mean trying to really get clothes and connect with someone I think my dad's ready motional unavailable my mom my mom was emotional like manipulation so she always like to use things against my dad because after the divorce I still saw my mom for a while until he got very tiring for me because it was just like every week I come back crying I took a lot of coping mechanisms from where I used to have to my life now and is that is very unhealthy
you laughed at him and you tend to do that so now it's just like I cannot say no to anybody care about yourself do you have to face the pressure of picking a site during the separation it was your grandparents
how can you find information it'll be an intellectual on how you feel about it. And Stacy this person like a black person do you still like Mom and Dad so when you say these kinds of things your father has like this Mr that she's kept for like so many so many years and now they have a son and it's okay that seems like a pretty bad behavior coming from anybody else I would be like but how many minutes of your time now in a week I don't want to dredge up. Even back then when I had to pick us up right it was very painful because something and other parent
no moon but he's a good guy everybody that guy yes it's evolved car and I love the way to divorce
honestly not really not really because I didn't really talk about it you know what I told my friends they were quite nice about the more you talk about it the last it's off like huts and you start to realize I see a lot of people have similar experiences like for like family-wise I mention that you know people are doing a show you more care in that says every school it was very prominent Dallas Street a bit differently because I was announced to the whole school news goes around after that Secondary School
if you took what time bag time would you have preferred your parents to continue staying together tension just hope everybody in the household you know sometimes I'm trying to hide from everything but you know that I would not want to live today how is your relationship like with your parents now is pretty good I think we both my parents especially my mom very close with my dad I think it was so shaky it is thought definitely I used to be that quite like a Denny's go acting distant but that's not because of the lack of effort. I think it's because you only see each other once a week and you just want to spend a good time to get us so you're doing really talked about like a feeling I don't go on like hikes with my dad wants to know
so you're just enjoyed a quiet time together I got quite close to my dad actually texted my mom now in South of the above and then I think my brother off. Well my brother and my dad went to therapy and then after that they came back they show me what happened you know so we kind of like that before or the Block in corals and doing what no I just told her that you know where are healing from this on our own together whatever but I hope she do it so strange you know like that sometimes you have to be a bigger person and just let it go I mean
that's amazing is Bree like for you to just say I hope you do all the healing on your own you know and with your new family because it's a big move for the person who has been the victim victim of circumstance something good that came out on how to be independent and self-sufficient just for my mom's phone example I used to be a romantic I was just thinking of running off into the sunset you know with my beloved and now it's more like well you know sometimes and that is not free you know and it made me look more realistic about you know expecting things from people because even if you find somebody who's perfect in every way
you can still mess up their relationship with them you really make me become like a little I doubt you know I feel like if I didn't have this whole divorce thing I felt like I would have just keep everything in because I used to do that very often at the kids and I think that is something that you know to do that how has your parents divorce changed your perspective of a family from the flats of a car that is taken in the water of the womb so I always say that if it's something that I can you can hold it close to people around you that has helped you go through all my friends extended family
very strict with me and my brother she really did teach me a lot of things and do you still believe in marriage because aside from the divorce which I'm sure has played a part in this answer but I feel like you do love someone marriage in today is like an administrative piece of paper
and if you see something benefits in Singapore has you in the encourage you to get married because in securing a house is easier to be confirmed by one of them become found by anybody other than the two of you so you know you don't really need marriage to solve like
make it real with me this is a goal that you I'm definitely down for it. What is your name my name is Rachel
I guess I'll go eat I don't like
my situation is very different from yours and from the next person is going to be wildly different kinds of things for someone going through it right now in this very moment it's frightening it's scary is uncertain my advice is to not be afraid to ask for help when you know you can trust first of all you need to know is like it's it's the consequences but you know that it's really not your fault because I feel that they feel responsible for it
Haitian parents while I'm going through a divorce from the point of view of a child address the situation of a child need to be explained to the childhood of because explaining it to like that it really communication is something that you really cannot do as parents your responsibility is your child no matter how difficult it is to even breathe Auto understand the pain that have cost you a side salad dressing the whole thing between you guys in the most mature way possible without the whole life I want you on my side you know kind of thing you need to tell them in the most Mutual way possible what's going to happen why it's happening without degrading your partner in front of your child and what could happen next for the child

"How do you say, do? How do you say welcome back to Clementi?"
"We are back and look at all these sick today, so cute. But I don't know if you read this right now. The person we are going to be talking about my one, right? We'll try to pull down. My thing is something that is a universal you. No concern for my mother-in-law, to listen, very closely to the show. I think she's seen and heard has pockets as well and all about you. You are great. You are great. German has told us everything about you. How do I self Mommy? I know. I know you guys think you could get your general thoughts are right about mother-in-laws. What do you guys think?"
"Let's not tread carefully. Be honest, you know, what is your impression of this concept? Honestly? Right now, I think mother-in-law's are someone who can help me get to know, my husband better answer the light horror stories. Right? So I took that stuff like shapes our perception that like, they like scary and very nice and things like that. So that sticks. You see, it's like that. It may not be true. But that's all you think I understand. Yeah, I think we've been conditioned by stereotypes to think that mother-in-law's are difficult, but I think we'll share you some about personal experiences and we'll see what we agree on every episode in Lost and said that picture when he's getting serious and all that. And"
"For some reason, right? It does seem like women struggle more than men in this aspect. When it comes to in-laws, you agree to women in the family. That's bound to be some kind of conflict. Some kind of struggle session but doesn't necessarily have to be so I don't think so. I don't think so. I think we've been conditioned to think this week, but we can change that. That's right, and I'm sure that guy. So if you don't know that Lloyd she's as well. So we don't have discovered that don't come in guys, have father-in-law issues like your dad, trying to approve of your boyfriend and having that sort of situation, right weight, but mostly a little bit awkward and how to navigate that whole situation. If you are in a good situation,"
"So, how is your relationship? Like with your mother-in-law? Your mom and his mom?"
BP oil.
"Relationship, I do. I do. I'm very lucky and I am very lucky is well, I know it's a rarity. I know. I'm very blessed Leticia, but I'm sincere go Maritime. Others has been a thief. The video call each other. Every day is a problem because when you first met her, I mean, you guys were already family friends, but when you first met her as like, I am going to marry your son with it like chocolate. All actually right? I think when we first started going out quite ugly in that time already, another family that compass into light, bring you home or like me a family for me is my wife on the real kind of thing, but it's like he was going out with me."
Who's that mean? You will never
"Okay. So basically when you first went out with them, it was very early on in the relationship that she like you."
I want to think so. Nope. I remember those Lost episode when I said that. It would have met me before I remember. Yes. Because the mother called him and asked him to come home cuz I was there. So the mother sorry for you as a potential already and was it a bit lucky number?
"Evil Within, and this one is like to struggle with mother-in-law scary. Scary, my little lost but there was a point where I used to see why"
It makes a book a relationship. I will Express My Views in a bit.
"I think with my future mother-in-law, we got off to a rocky start. I will see because he's an only child. He's been very protected his whole life in turn to love him to death. Right? So I don't really know if this is a situation but maybe there was a bit of like she was feeling a little bit insecure, the oldest another woman in his life, now taking care of him and I took care of him at 16 years old. I was very good at it, you know, and have him, apply for you. And you know, that. She's always been the center of their family, real girlfriend to Hebrew home. So it was off to a rocky start at that time, but never the debt. Nevertheless. They love me. Like I'm that one doctor. So we broke up right up. I will tell you about the first time I met them, but I'll talk about the first time I saw him again after we got back together."
"So we went to his drama. I was so nervous and they greeted me with a big smile. And hot me, they told me that you miss me, or call me like I'm their own. And I treat them like my own parents even though we're not married yet, but I love him. So, so, so much like the kind of, like, the way better for, for the Assan, your future husband, and for the entire family in general. Definitely, I think we've grown a lot over the last few years and now, everything is just as beautiful. I love them. I love you. And be there for me. Right back when I was leaving. Jordan. I remember one of the first few times, he brought me back home. He's mother or rating, you. That I was going to be coming back home. So she was sending it."
"Units of car, read, all of the ballot in the balcony, looking for a ride to find someone to take care of him. So I think she was all smiles, cookies, amazing food, all the kind of thing. I think I'm blocking. This is because I don't think I've ever dated someone with a mother who didn't approve of me except for one in secondary school. I mean, no, no, no, no. No, I think so. So I didn't relationship blew over in like, what would make the best of it?"
"It's not imagine any mother in love with. No approve of hazing impress, your mother hit us up. It's early. Dealing with in-laws. It's just I think it's a tricky situation, especially in Asia household because we want to be very respectful of them. We want to please them and make them happy. But sometimes, you know, they just have like a preconceived idea of what the Dolphin bar should be. And you might not be that you might not match up to the end of people can relate. That you feel very nervous around your in-laws. You don't know what to say. What I say the wrong thing. Do wrong things. That's actually this story, right? From one of our listeners. She went to her boyfriend's, place to have dinner with the family. The mom that she offered her. Durian. Okay, and she said, I'm so sorry. I'm full. It's okay. I don't want to. OK Google."
She didn't want to deal with the food.
"Full, I rejected in a polite manner. Why is it from, what would you have done in? This situation is exactly offering foot when the other party already said that he or she is close to her. Is Manas eat that other people don't get to eat. Asking she does is a lot to my sister-in-law, my brother's wife. And on the contrary. My brother is not like this guy in question. My brother would be the one telling my mom. Mom. Can you please talk to you? Even if it's just for, your partner is very important and you don't understand the situation as well."
"Tricky. Because while you don't want to overstep boundaries, you don't because you also don't want you to assure her that you are still the queen. In this life. You have to take over your place. I think it really depends on your partner's upbringing as well. If they were brought up in a family like maybe like he's, he's off of work to you and, you know, then naturally he would think that the polite thing to do is to just eat it. Completely, the Fannie May be in that household, you was being fought from Young that if someone offers you food, you cannot reach out if your normal thing whatever. But when I first went out with Lisa for it and I'll use my phone at the dinner table. He would tell me separately after dinner that his parents don't like that, ever since then or a brisket."
"My phone died. He made the right move because he told you separately after dinner. Try to keep true. True. At the end of the day. I unpack a little bit about the different kinds of mother-in-laws that we might have heard of. Okay, that your friends. Are you have experienced the narcissistic mother in law, the one that needs to be at the center of attention at all times. Maybe she's used to that growing up me know and she doesn't want the daughter-in-law to take over that role in the family, feeling a bit intimidated, maybe a bit threatened, right? Or maybe they want you to be exactly like how deep is a value system of beliefs and if you're not they feel like you're not but you have to recognize that no two people on Earth has the exact same values in Tivoli, correct. Siblings."
"A mother. And she went through a lot, a lot, a lot, a case of the get-go. She was not happy about this marriage. When we were deciding to get married, but she was reluctant to share the hall. And then eventually, they had to move in with her. She was not happy with her son, helped out with house chores. He expected the, his wife would be the one, doing the House Hotel 2021 guy. So he can you eat."
"You want to meet up if you don't see, if you do, exactly, you need to go for a coffee. Okay, so she had seemed, she had a preconceived notion of what had gotten lost or pee, and she didn't match up to it. And that's why she was against. It was a baby involved in the baby came. Usually, she would show the baby that's in my friend. Whenever there are people at the house is a bit inconvenient for her to, like, get out the room and everything. So I'm husband, or child the baby, but one day there was nobody in the house except for the mother-in-law and then and then you and Dee, that's a very, very difficult situation to be in a relationship with a child and all that."
"That child correct? Let's keep this in mind. Whatever that we seeing right now. When we become mother-in-law's, y'all better not be like that. I would never be like like babies are the kind where you fear that you will be judged or you feel that you can leave it by your in-laws for anything that you do, you feel that pressure to look, perfect, be perfect all the time. What do you guys think? The first few meetings he is when I met my ex Jordan's mom, I was present throughout, I would definitely know how. Does broccoli, make sure nothing don't know. Look at a few more meetings after that. I feel like the picture so I can just"
By that one and that is a blessing. Have you heard of cases? Where mother-in-law's are? They labeled the daughter-in-law?
"Now when I wait, no crop tops, she'll just she will casualty light."
"I was very scared because two months ago, is this is his foot that do in his life BTW? The tattoo is one of the state is a slip of wagyu beef. Okay? I don't know why he's very interesting. Don't ask me menu, right? Because I think I caught him to get a OK Google. Can you please help me? I got that too. And before you ask me to get one."
"Sold me out. You know what? I mean? What do I do with? Judge me because I was so angry, when he found out. He didn't know. I'm going to get more upset that he has some thoughts about being labeled by the in-laws. Okay. So this person says, I didn't know what to do my laundry. When I moved in with my in-laws it was so awful as my mother-in-law to wash my undergarments, even though she has two daughters of her own that have moved out already."
Do I wash my own and this in the toilet or bring it back home to my parents home to wash it? I think what she did is Right years. I would never want my mother-in-law to wash my undergarments and I think it's true. It's true.
"I regret I regret him and his dad then hot. It's just for a funeral. So I use the bathroom. Then I threw my pet away in her little thespian. She was very upset that I threw away inside the Dustbin and not like outside, right? At home. When I use my bathroom, the darkness want me to throw it right by the whole situation. And there was something and it made me very fearful lot. In the first phase of like, using anything of hers, or you're being in his face or anything, But how did you convey to you that she was upset? I think it was through."
Bring it back.
"Going to shoot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When it comes to my own family vs. My boyfriend's family even wearing something. In my part of the sun is about it. I usually don't do anything and remain confident about my childhood friend that sees parents comment, that yoga is quite bold off a dressing like this, even though they have no ill. Intentions, next time. I do extra pressure to dress more conservatively. We just have to say this memo about Clarity Kemah is like a Modell's Modell's? Sorry Modo. She is so low fashion. You have no idea. How can you marry my son try to understand what she means because with your own parents yell at you."
But treat them with respect this difficult.
What do you want me to just let go?
"Okay, then I'm going over. Okay. I try sometimes. Still don't let you know when I can. I can other days too because if she knows, I'm going over. Then she'll be like, can you dress more appropriately. Sometimes it's alright. Let's say I did intend on going. Okay. I didn't wrestle the occasion who then I'll be like."
"I usually like to go see anything or not. It's okay, but you still feel a bit like my mother. She will say you not call me to do a jacket. I do give some thought to what? I wear that, because when I see my in-laws, right, I usually want to dress like cute. You always see me if I'm dressing in something cute to. Okay, what about the assumption that mother-in-law's, a evil the out to get you, the threat. I think this is the one that we see most and dramas movies."
"To break up with Rachel because of his mother, you know, that they have expectations of. What does enlarge mean? Like both cook clean, you know, take care of the Sun and all that. But I feel like things have really changed. Any of your mother-in-law's. Expect you guys to cook or clean or I think Jordan's Mama last time. She really what that we did not cook."
Stop all.
"I bought you The Vacuum Cleaner dealer how to cook eggs in law to act certain ways to be the most submissive one when it comes to the relationship. But I think I was lucky in a sense where it says, mom is the only female in the family. She was treated like a queen from the get-go, like she is the queen anything that she wants to get from the Sun in from the debt, which I love that was going to stay over at his house when we were dating. I would make his bed and I never ever do that. I can be"
"How is right now? Just being nice or just cleaning up after yourself, which I think is okay. And he reflects well on the self every time I I am in a competition with them. I try to be as polite as possible, engage them in conversation. Correct. A bit like, or are they just not saying, you know, maybe they think it like I'm not doing enough. So basically this another. I said an older brothers."
"Did you really cook that? She was sad that comfy and I don't think they expected. I should be doing more. I say that. I mean, you have your qualities and you make up them in your own ways."
"No, but definitely know. Each person has a different office. If you made a great first impression on your mother-in-law, from one of our listeners, who actually wrote in that is not so much of the positive side. Wheel speaking, my mannerism, and everything has been very heavily criticised by my in-laws. Thankfully. I have a supportive husband, but it has been really a roller coaster ride that has been wasn't supportive. Situation is right."
"The setting is at First Impressions really do, and they lost so you can go in Brazil. Need to your in-laws and just act. However, you want you to want me to take shelter, directions Master, right? So we all know that the significance of it was a reason why people say sometimes, like when your marrying someone, you not just marrying them, you made the entire family. Exactly taking that. Count. As much as you do, we want to and a lot of things that we have set, right? Is promoting, you know, being a selfish and treat yourself and things like that as much as you want that, that's also fine line and it's also the being considerate being polite and knowing that at the end of the day, you're still sort of in the tough. And you want to add as much as"
"You want to miss that, you, I think you have to also set up like me in the middle of things that you don't usually do it. Stop being a hypocrite. If you do it. Now, it just meeting the middle or being respectful. And I think that, you know, when it comes to your in-laws, he's right. Everyone comes with baggage. Is that family? Then you just need to make a piece of that. Is it worth being with him? Because some people are really in a situation where the in-laws are very unreasonable, but that's just a big difference in expectation. When it comes to being this person's girlfriend and when you finally marry into the family and become his wife, will you expect a? Thank you, leave. A little early. I think. Maybe I'm not the best."
"But also, because I'm so thankful that my mother-in-law is so good to me since day one. As the only, I mean, I haven't ever see this out but like, a few months ended a relationship after they first met me, a few months in."
Have you?
Esperanza and it's has a girl. Least we telling you you soon. She wants us to help her son out with securing the bag by buying you a bag. It whooped.
"You know, the way to your heart better than your husband is a difference. I think between before and after I don't really think. So, give me this is just be but you get advice but it's a bit hot for you to do anything about it. You know, I mean, like what I do for me, I feel like maybe they want me there. More often. They want you with a family more often because every family is and I didn't grew up that way. Like, I live with my mother, I can do and see if a week and how you live your own life. I correct. Correct, but they all like my sit down together and everything myself together. My schedule for me to adopt as well, because my own mad at you different culture."
"Sit right with me every week, or when are you working this weekend? But do you want to know the dates yet. Maybe you can come on Sunday to let you all like that. I can do not. Look at all. The best friend is in Taiwan, after married to the family. She moved into the house or it's a guy and her mother-in-law is so nice. So nice. She always office to make her breakfast make a brat. But if she's writing for what she was telling about the law. It's okay, tomorrow. I don't eat breakfast. People make it juicy Brown the table as you still pressurized. She has to take it with her. She's supposed to eat it because she's going to throw it away in Westport right by. And another thing is, if the Mother-in-law makes her a cup of milk, and after drinking it, she was just a cup. And then, there was one time."
"I said what you look up to put it back to you Monday? Use the toilet after she come back out. She know this a mother-in-law really watching that cop that she just washed and it's nice enough to like not expect her to be when it comes to taking care of a body yoga Street and all that kind of thing, but she feels so stifled. I already washed the cop. Why do you have to rewash it? Already told you? I don't know. Why do you still give me? How do you please start dinner without me by to come home? Sing the whole family sitting and waiting for me to text, so stressed out as it is, so positive and negative. I don't know if this is a good problem to have. Would you choose this kind of situation or the kind where they criticize you to your face?"
"If you're not be angry at it, because it is, for example, he's he's whole situation where your mother-in-law didn't approve of you because of religion. Like that is a really, really difficult situation to be in, especially if you're in an interracial or Interfaith relationship, right? Yeah. So I think if you are attached to someone who is of a different faith and you, you need to educate yourself, do research, and understand what is appropriate in that culture in defeating noise in for yourself hurt. Your partner Hut think? So how do we build a good relationship without in-laws listening? Maybe I know some of us and so that lucky like a zoo and remain, right?"
Can you marry my son?
"Okay. So what are some tips that we can share? I think you need to understand the Dynamics of their family. That's very important right now often, do they meet as a family with a very close-knit, the are you might have to make some sacrifices in your own life to meet them a bit more regularly and understand the boundaries as well between your family. Are you and them and how you can make that work. I think communication is key be in the form of a WhatsApp group chat or like face-to-face. I mean, worst comes to worst. I think you should talk to your partner about anything that you're uncomfortable with and get Dan to politely, convey, the message to their parents. Honestly, I feel like"
"Asbestos possible, it would be great if you can."
"Not live with them. I think that saves relationships. Yeah. Yeah, I see where you're coming from. If you can, I think that would be a good thing to do. Although I am to live in a place yesterday was hello. Hello."
"Ariana, is he knows that he's a sweetie pie. You know what am I doing? Kdrama? She calls you. I'm not your wife. She loves you. Like those Communications really important because no family is perfect. Right, but if you and you're not on the same page and you guys can go in the same page to do the family. I think that will give you the best chance possible and if not right, showered them with gifts. So even though I've been in a relationship for so many years did approve of me right every week when I see them. I'll bring them something. It doesn't matter. What is one vehicle be hair, conditioner, one way. It could be, you know, the flower soap thing. She was over the moon that it's only about four dollars $5."
"I don't like the music you just don't they lost but both sides of it, which I seen your partner is very, very important because you were really the friction between your own family and your partner is quitting. Is the Ace of this. The bridge for me and my family, I think I do."
"One moment, especially women in their twenties, the weekly collected, some advice from the gravity team on how to deal with your in-laws, especially mother-in-law's joke with them and agree with them and be attentive. And proactive, for example, if they're going to clean up even if they don't want you to clean up, you have a. Can I, how can I help? I know they do. I M. How can I help? Okay, so important thing, if your mother-in-law Cooks always compliment her food,"
That's right.
"How to build a relationship with your mother-in-law to treat her out for dinner and holidays. Lost love language and making the effort to express. That is very important is reading body language. I think when you meet your in-laws, right, y'all should all just do the quiz. Just go in there and help if their love language is quality time."
"What you think? Okay. Let me send my mother-in-law, even the sisters, even this isn't lost. All this is very important. I need to pick up when like, my mom keeps offering her food and all it has things, you know, and is awkward for her to reject, my siblings, which is a husband and my other sister can come is a picture to helpful healing respecting. What does sister wants is important. I am the sister."
"What's a producer has also say, it is very important that you get to know their family values and everybody has a different way of bringing that we come in earlier. So drained button that you find something. Common between you that you can get along and talk about and maybe do something together. Next. I think it is a perfect sentence to read out the episode. It is important for us to normalize, not having a perfect relationships, without in-laws all boyfriend's family. You might not have a perfect relationship with your family and you expect you to be perfect, right with someone else. What would you advise be to someone who has yet to meet the in-laws dating already? Haven't seen them for the first time yet. Find out as much as you can from your other half about his parents, and then just make sure you go with whatever they. Like. I said, of serving your own partner Yuma."
Get a sensible because he must have gotten those things from somewhere. I would say sending the love language quiz.
"Your boyfriend right in. Not so good relationship with their in-laws. I think I'll say it's never too late to try to mend it. However hard it is for you to let your ego down that aside. I think it's worth a shot for yourself, your husband and your future kids. I think we don't know the extent of your situation. It could be horrible, you know, it could be something really really tough and it may look like something that it's unsolvable or something. They can't come out off because any other day it's two parties. And while you can change yourself, you can meet in the middle. You can even go beyond that middle life, but the other person won't change is very hot. And, you know, honestly, you can't expect them to change all so you can try and discuss, you can try and find a middle ground, but I think they are all sitting out there."
"It's true. So I would say it's very important that you and your partner in this together with the situation, if you guys are not so serious yet. Is it a deal-breaker for you? Right? Because if it comes to like, emotional manipulation and abuse from your in-laws, and that's not a good situation to be in it. It's as though, your own partner is abusing you. So even though you should try your best of mended, but put your your mental health, first and daughter-in-law still. Have a great relationship. Yes. Yes."
It is definitely possible. All right with that. Thank you so much for listening to this episode of Cloudy.

Phone call.
"I have some great comebacks for you. Okay, if anyone asked you it might have been."
"Okay, I'll have Kim. Kids are when you stop asking me this question. He's Asian women by Southeast Asian, women, exploring conversations, around Health, the South community and left. My name is Nicole, and I am your producer and host."
"So when we set out to do this season on something, private is the feature stories from across southeast Asia as a gumball, there are so many amazing things that deserve to be in a spot. Like one of these individuals is Malaysian celebrity chef East. Lemon sauce was introduced by a friend who watches have videos on it and proceeded to stock up on Instagram, immediately arrested by police extreme. Some of the conditions that many women struggle in Silence, with polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS short, as well as endometriosis. Now, if it's your first time hearing about it, these are actually women's health conditions that are extremely common but also extremely and they diagnosed because of a variety of reasons."
"Many of times women sucking from his conditions are brushed off as having emotional outbursts or a simple thing that it's not painful enough to see how her conditions PCOS and endometriosis a journey as a celebrity chef and how you can identify whether these are some of the conditions that you might be experiencing as well. Release alignment. I am busy in Kuala Lumpur. I am 36 years old and I am food host on Asian Food Network, and I am also a food printer here in Kuala. Lumpur, Malaysia. I rewind this by Ellie, which is a platform sharing recipes in Toronto for and also import Steamboat & Grill delivery service. I could say a blanket that I've always been very passionate about food. Food is always been kind of the constant thing that makes me happy."
"So from very little in a very first memories of of mine were always in the kitchen, or eating something or even my on my travels. I remember places be some food. But, you know, as you grow up, you don't really realize that this is something that you can make a career out of, and I really didn't think that I would go into television, it all happened. Because I started my food delivery business, back in 2014, and then I started getting all these inquiries about how do you make this recipe? How do you clean fake Asian? You know, I had all these questions from my customers and then I thought, why don't I just put myself on TV and answer these questions so that, you know, if one or two people that are asking it and I'm also wondering sometimes then what's the best way of doing? It is just be yourself and TV, and that's when I entered Asian food, hero Talent, search in 2015. And then"
"I want which was a shock because I never thought that I would get far. Is it to completion? Let alone win. And I guess after that, you know, a series of opportunities are presented itself. So, from being a food hero winner, in 2015 of History, my food delivery business in Tiffin carriers with expanding very quickly. And then I started up a social Enterprise at that time, call the other guy initiative. And then we had the opportunity to open our first restaurant, which was very exciting. And at the same time, I was also shooting by the sea with Indy, which is a show on Asian Food Network. And, you know, a lot of things were happening at the same time and, you know, you stay, stay in your twenties. You have all the energy in the world, to do whatever you want, and you don't make the mistakes and learn, and that's it."
"How do I did a threw myself into work without a blink of an eye without even a pause? And then that's when I think things went a little bit South waiting for you. It was, I think it was a multifaceted and it it started off with me feeling very tired like that just exhausted, you know, working at the restaurant, you know, from you know, I would come in a bit later like at lunch service, but I would have been in the office from like 6 to 7 in the morning and then going to the restaurant and being there all day and then the late at night and then after finish work, hang out with your friends or, you know, I'll just try and catch up with your social life and I was doing that constantly."
"And then if I am not at the restaurant, o e t a l, I would have been on shoots and that would require traveling. Right? So, I will travel to Indonesia to Singapore when I was doing by the sea. I was in Thailand and Vietnam to a lot of traveling, a lot of different locations and shooting, you know, sometimes 10 12 hours, 14 hours Outdoors by the sea was outdoors, in the hot sun. And, you know, and at the same time, coming back to the hotel room and replying to emails and install site hustling, you know, so I started seeing the exhaustion first and then also, I started losing a lot of hair and then I started gaining weight, even though I was really active, you know, doing 10,000 steps a day or two, but I was gaining the weight and I wasn't even changing anything. I was eating."
"Eating the same food and then my moods, my mood started to change. I thought that being very irritated and hot-tempered and I could feel myself being very unhappy was very unhappy. Yeah, so that's that's kind of like the teal science by me I guess because some of the symptoms do sound a bit like but not which is probably I think what you were experiencing."
"Need help. It's not something that is sustainable anymore. I think like I really didn't listen to my body at all. Yeah, it was born out and I thought. Okay. This is but you know that was kind of like the bus with everybody was using as you know, and tripping or is that everybody is not okay to make sure that you don't but not and so I was like, okay, this is this, is this this feeling and then what happened next was I she I started kind of having issues with a lot of my friends, my suck my very close circle of friends. There was, there was a lot of I guess, guilt on myself on my side for not being as sociable as I used to be your not be as Dependable as I used to be. So that was a lot of friendship breakups, that happened during this period of time as well, which affected me emotionally, so I guess the physical exhaustion came from work and then"
"Emotional exhaustion came from the Friendship breakup. And this was like this was the chemistry reaction that triggered the PCOS. So what happened next with my. Stopped? This was early 2018. I was like, this is weird. Right? I went and saw the gynecologists and then, you know, very simple questions. She asked me. How was my sleep?"
"What, what brings you in and then I told her my chips really bad. My periods are irregular. And she's like, have you put on weight, you know, cuz I go every year. So she sees Mariah and she saw that I put on quite a bit of weight. So she said, yes, she's like, I think you might have polycystic ovarian syndrome, which is PCOS, but let's take a blood test in ca for sure. And then so we took a blood test in about three days later. She called me up and she said, please come in and want to have a chat with you. I know. This is the first time I've ever heard about polycystic ovarian syndrome. I had no idea and turn off when in. And that's when she showed me, the blood test results and it was insulin was super high in my insulin. At that time was around a 36. 38 percentile to a normal with a normal insulin reading would be less than 10. So mine was about three, three to four times higher. And then she did."
"A scan and she saw a little sis on my uterus and ovaries area. So she said, okay. These are the signs of polycystic ovarian syndrome when I don't think, you know, what exact ecos is in the information around it, maybe has gotten better over the years and is very new and very recent. So could you tell us what exactly is PCOS in your mentioning certain symptoms? That were they out of the state without Hill signs that you have PCOS. So, what are they the symptoms vary from cysts on your ovaries, which you can only tell via Skype weather is vagina scan or an ultrasound. Irregularities."
"Hello, or hi growth inside of your chest area. Your face face, area weight, gain insulin. So in tune with you insolent, high or low."
"It's hard to eat fuel in, Salinas is high. So these are some of the symptoms are many other other symptoms. But these are the five, I would say mean symptoms. If you have these symptoms, at least three of them, then you are diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Now polycystic ovarian syndrome. It is not a woman's fault and I have to emphasize. It is actually a genetic condition. So it's most likely your mother or your grandmother or someone in your dad's side of the family has it. So it's I just want to put a blanket there that if you guys are feeling like,"
"Like how I felt when I first found out that maybe I wasn't looking off to myself. It's not your fault is actually genetics and it stays dormant until something triggers it. So in my case, like I mentioned is now it was exhaustion, physical exhaustion and emotional stress, that triggered my PCOS. I have a really good friend of mine. Who's I have PCOS until she had her second child, really. It can happen to anybody in some of the statistics statistics, which is unfortunate. We don't have the most current one in Malaysia. The last week, the last kind of Journal that I read that calculated. How many women actually have it in Malaysia is 1 out of 10 women in Malaysia. So this is like a beast in the early 90s. So, you know, we need some funding to do some more research on this, especially in in Southeast Asia, but one in ten in 1990 is still very high."
"I didn't know numbers now. And another thing that is also very worrying, is polycystic, ovarian syndrome in Solomon. 50% the time they don't even have symptoms in a reason to be. So because every woman is different right to different triggers. Could result in, like different changes to the body and then pick up to see. But I think you shit a very interesting and it. Which was that after you were diagnosed, if you have PCOS, you actually develop endometriosis. So, tell me a bit more about that because that, you could end up getting both though. It's a policy to Arrangement syndrome. I have endometriosis and because of my PCOS, I also have a thyroid deficiency."
"Homo. No, it's no wonder. I was going crazy. You know, I was only diagnosed in October of last year in the reason why I wasn't like, I was diagnosed with it is because I started having these really severe pains during my. All of a sudden, you know, so once I got a case, so let's rewind a little bit. So once I go, diagnose, I was bought metformin for 3 months. My. Start becoming regular and I started looking after myself. I wouldn't say that I was being great about it. I tried. Okay? Because I'm still learning about my condition and then suddenly like last year, my. Started being a little bit more heavier and very painful and then it will go to the point where even when I was not having my. Or I would cough or be a little bit if I was exerting myself a little bit more."
"I would have a Shopkins and I was okay with this is weird. This is not cool. Right? So I was due for a checkup anyway, so I went and I saw a different gynecologist so went to see her and issues at all. I can see that this is why you're you're having lots of pain. So basically my ovaries I have all these little bills this which is the policy ovarian syndrome. Very very normal. And then there was this monster with an endometriosis and the way you can tell the difference is PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome. The cysts are white in color and Under the Skin with endometriosis is black."
Which means that there is a so it's like a fluid that is blood fluid that has created kind of like a cyst on any part of your uterus. So the difference is with
"PCOS is a hormone imbalance. Right? So the insulin, the perfect way of describing it. As if you look at a cop. Can you have a car? Your mother is telling you to put the syrup sugar insulin into the top. So, your body is trying to put the syrup into the cup, but it's not going in, it's spelling out. So your mother is keeping tell me why you not feeling the cut with syrup. I'm telling you to fill it up with. So what happens is all the insulin goes all around your body and it gets stuck into your uterus. Basically. I'm trying to describe it in a way that is not scientific. So people get it. So what happens is that the insulin"
"It's not metabolized and that's why you gain weight and that's why you get this cyst. Okay, where else in endometriosis? What happens is that thickening of the lining creates? It's not, it doesn't completely clear out. And there is a growth that get stuck there physically, and every month that you have your. It just grows and grows. I don't know. I haven't read much about endometriosis and the reasoning behind this, but that's what was explained to me by my doctor. So my endometriosis was I guess quite small, maybe in the beginning of last year."
"And then I guess with stress of work and, you know, and just like I was starting to really take care of myself, but I was it was hard for me to let go of work and things like that, and personal personal things that was going on in my life, as well. So I guess because of that, the Andrew metriosis started growing, and that's when I started having those pains and with endometriosis for, as long as you have your. It will always come back and honesty, endometriosis, and they said that it develops, several years after women, get all the people who has the female reproductive system, start their menstruation, right? And I think the cause us a kindly and clear, but you and this is something that you should do. So if it's in your family history, then the chances of you getting it is"
"Increase as well, correct. For for me personally, like my endometriosis like, was I, I was hurting, I saw the guy who's very fast. Sorry. I was hurting August September, October or September. I saw my gynecologist, October, she diagnosed me and then in December, I had it removed and then I really had to have a really honest conversation with myself, and was like, I I, I had to show that was supposed to schedule to be shot in December. I canceled it because I was like, look, I got to be real about how I'm I'm doing, you know, if I go on like, this is going to kill me literally, because I'll be in so much pain. I'll be miserable. I want to live life. You know, Life's Too Short. If anything covid has taught me is just like, life is too short, so,"
"And it's, it's it's a serious thing because it affects."
"Your light is women, right? When you have endo and you have PCOS and you you're trying to function as a as a human being. You're trying to do your best work at home with you. I know I'm a wife now is, is a, is a. They know, as well as a doctor as a friend. But inside you are your, your hormones are all over the place. You're in pain, you know, once a month, you you struggle for like 10 days. You were like, completely out of it, you know, you can't move. It makes it really hard in motion Alee and physically and mentally Is Not Great, you know, to be in that condition. So I just had to put a stop to it and I just told myself, like you need to look after yourself and that's exactly what I did. I stopped. Well."
"You know, I told myself, I'm just going to focus on the things that make me happy, which are my passion for intrapreneurship. So I had to do one business. So I just focused on one and then I just focus on my shows and in doing things like this, you know, being an advocate for polycystic, ovarian syndrome and and being open about talking about women health and periods and bleeding. And you don't going to going to the gynecologist, not being ashamed, and being comfortable in your own skin for so long. Like, I had no idea, you know, that this could all happen to me. I was completely oblivious. So, yeah, that's that's basically my agenda"

"Adding one thing that really struck me about you was that you are very open. You're very honest. Recommended about sharing about the condition in a way that was very active. So the pictures of pictures of myself. I'm in the hospital. You had, you know, life videos of yourself, answering questions, Instagram live. You talk about your hair loss. All these conditions are you know, things that"
"Typically be seen as I would say. And womanly and glamorous, you know, things that women who doesn't happen to them and yet you were very candid about sharing about it. So and wondering and also I think the hotel ml off when you, when you got your endometriosis, the aspect of recognizing that the pain is unbearable and I need to Quincy help because a lot of times as women, we are told that you will get menstrual cramps, right? And you like, okay just just behind them and it will get better and I'm wondering"
"What makes you want to show this site to your followers? All to the rest of the world? And what do you hope to achieve from it? I mean, ever since I started sharing about my journey about PCOS. I've been getting so many Indians, you have no idea and it's it, it's, it's really sad because, you know, we have a culture of a flight or we have to show a friend in all that we are, we are successful. We are happy. We are, you know, we have everything sorted and we look a certain way. Yes, you know, let's just be real about it because not everything is perfect. You know, and I guess"
"When I started talking about it and I started getting a lot of these messages from women who are young, who have no idea about women's health, and they think from Lynn, from hearing what I say in talking about my symptoms. They think that maybe they might have what I'm having, which explains a lot, and then you have. Also, I have a lot of DMS from women who are nutritionist in doctors, in telling me, encouraging me. And in, in sending me books in sending me articles for me to read two women who have struggled all of the life knowing that they have endometriosis and PCOS, and then, you know, now in their menopausal stage, also sharing their Journey, you know, of an hour or so, of course, the stories of the social,"
"Aspects of it. So you have this disease that affects women, but you also have the social stigma that is affected with me when you beat your ass. Because there is, there is a big misconception that women who have PCOS Kung Fu can get pregnant, you know, and so I have a lot of stories about families being torn apart because she can't bear with me and she can bear children and being outcasts, you know, by the in-laws. So, I just want to create a voice because I have nothing to lose. You know, like I have a very supportive has been very supportive, family. Awesome Doctor Who is so encouraging. She has she called me yesterday and was like, oh, you need to get on this thing, you know, so, and I have a really awesome support group, which I started with two other women who who are suffers of ecos"
"Was diagnosed with your ass at the age of 17. She's no, I think in her early thirties and Stephanie who is a pharmacist and she's the the, the friend that I said that he was diagnosed with PCOS after her second child. So the three of us are starting. Well, Nina is heading it. And we are kind of like helping her with the content call Mikey cos I love you. And basically what it says is what it is my PCOS. I love you. You don't need to hate it. You just need to understand it. And we are going to be talk to you about all the icky, icky stuff that you probably won't hear from your gynecologist or even some of your girlfriends, but you can have that Frank conversation with us and and there is, there is a need for it, you know, sometimes even talkin about your menstrual cycle in, so many words for. Right, menstrual cycle."
"Lahaina MC. Large print the works. So it's like, yeah, why, why is there so many covers for something that women have been having from the beginning of time? Why are we still hiding behind this? You know, and I just I just wish that you know someone at my mom who"
Probably has polycystic ovarian syndrome and never knew that she had Paula cystic ovarian syndrome. And who has been struggling with depression and with all of her life.
To for me to then get it at 36 years old and then go with my mom and be like Mom. I'm so sorry. And now I understand the pain that you have been going through all your life.
"I know and she had no idea until I got it until I was diagnosed. So I don't want that to happen. I don't want women to go through their life, feeling bad for the weedy feel of feeling ashamed for not being able to do certain things that Society requires you to do or whatever it is. I just, I want it all to stop is the fact that I don't want people to have to go through your life, not knowing and thinking that it's their fault that there's something wrong with them. And yes, there's something wrong with you and you can fix it. You can manage it and there's a Wii to do it. So that is why, you know, we recreated my PCOS. I love you because we want to have this on his compositions and and I'm an advocate for it. I want to know if in sharing your story because I would,"
"Assume that may be more conservative, factions of society, might be able to talk about anything related to reproductive Reproductive Rights. Yeah, if this but he did has called you out for real or any negative reactions that you have received. I mean, the only negative people have said that I have used my like PCOS as a reason."
"Do not participate or get involved or to stop something and I guess it's with a lot of against mental illnesses that you possibly cannot see because with PCOS, right? It's very internal. It's it's it's a emotional condition. It's a hormonal Condition. It's not like you're bleeding. And somebody can see a bandit. You know what I mean? It's a mental health condition. So it's like, so because there's not a lot of knowledge around it. There is not a lot of talk around it. There's not a lot of awareness that a lot of people think that I am using that as an excuse to get out of things, and"
"And I know for a fact that a lot of women who struggle with PCOS and sometimes or endometriosis, and sometimes you need to take the day off or the two days off. What is a probably thinking that, you know, they are just faffing around and taking you to Advantage. But it's not it's an actual disease and it's something that needs to be treated with respect, like all the other diseases and the scary part is it affects a lot of women. So"
"People just better watch out because your mom's might have it your sisters might have it. You know, I mean your grandmother's might have it. So it's it it's something that that that yes, it's taboo, but I haven't gotten any backlash. Actually. A matter of fact, I do get a lot of messages from Men Who message me and say, you know, Ali like thank you so much for sharing your story. My wife is going through what you're going through, and I just want to say thank you for your content. I had someone who message me, your husband who messaged me and said, my, my wife is going in to remove, she doesn't have endometriosis. She has, I do another condition where it's really severe that you have to remove your uterus and, you know, watching your videos together has really encouraged us to stay positive, you know, and things like that. So, if anything know and if I'm"
You say anything to me. I'll just block.
"Because I don't need that negativity when I'm trying to help others. So yeah, if you can, you nobody has time for that. You can move away from my page. I want to add on to the point that you mentioned at the beginning that you have a gynecologist that you regularly visit. Right? But I think that for a lot of women who are not"
"Expecting having a gynecologist is very rare. Like, nobody, I'm having cramps. I, this is not happening to me. I'm going to pay my visit. Let you know how people would pay the dentist. Visit every like, maybe six to nine months like that doesn't happen for for, for Women's Health. So, I think it's a huge thing that has to be changed. Even myself is why I don't do it. Because I never grew up knowing that this, right. This is an element of my house that I have to pay more attention to so. Yeah, I think it's a big issue. A very interesting point here because I like the minute you have your. Right."
"You have to start going to see a gynecologist. Maybe not in your early teens. Maybe you can do once every two years. But you know, once you hit your twenties, so my apologies explain to me that your body changes every 7 years. So when you're 17, you're 14, you're 21, 28 and so on and so forth. So when your body changes things change, right? Your hormones, change your body changes your cycle changes. You're so you do need to check in."
"Check. Literally do a check in with your your your women B, you know, and there's a lot of Shame about going to see a gynecologist because you are not married by a gynecologist is a doctor that is a thing called privacy between, you know, there is a thing called when you go see, I don't do, you know what, whatever this discuss, whatever that is, that is checked on is between you and your doctor, but I guess, you know, coming from an Asian culture that"
"It's not something that you said that you grew up knowing that all your mom would say, open the, I'm going to go to see the gynecologist, right? Correct? You hardly see that but your mom will tell you what you going to go see the dentist, but she will never see my gynecologist and you know, I don't understand why, you know, if you can go and check your teeth, every 6 months, to 9 months. Why can't you go see the gynecologist? So I mean I come from I would see fairly open family and my dad go out with women around him. So I never felt ashamed to tell me that I've got my. Late, you know, it don't bother me, but I know a lot of households don't have that openness, right? Me being an advocate in talking about. I'm talking about. What is your brain syndrome is trying to get my peers who are now bearing children of your own to start having"
"Conversation with your little ones when, as they are developing and growing and being open about their B, you know, and it's very important and I want to talk a bit about your experiences and your relationship is like your followers, cuz I think it is quite Special. AM something that you share with them. Are there any stories from women that has to do with you all, stood out that you thought, you know, what's interesting or very moving that you feel like you can share. Yeah. I mean, I have a lot of them and she said I would categorize them in in, in, in these, I guess categories. So you have the, the family members who have a woman in your life who suffer from polycystic, ovarian syndrome. And then those are like the men who which I think are really sweet for them to like"
"Read out to me and be like, hey, by the way, you know, what you're doing is awesome. Then you be able to have like the really I would say the really tragic stories that they have the social stigma to it. So we have, I have women who message me and say, you know, I have I think I have polycystic ovarian syndrome, but I'm too ashamed to go to the doctor because, you know, I've had sexual encounters before night and not married and I don't want the gynecologist to, to know, you know, or judge me, you know, which is so sad and in the Deep themselves out because, you know, they had sex out of out of marriage and now the because they are suffering, they cannot go and see a doctor."
2
"To be able to find the reasons behind their suffering, which is very heavy for me. And this is why like, a lot of young women probably find it very open to speak to me, and I'll find them the right doctors that they can go to without any judgment. And then you also have the really sad stories of like, you know, like I mentioned before, families being torn apart because I can't bear children. I've been trying for 12 years and, you know, my in-laws don't talk to me anymore. My sister-in-law my, in a nobody on my, my husband side, talk to me anymore. So we have had to move."
"States. So, you know, these are the kind of stories that that I shared with me and it just really does inspire me and keep me going. I feel a lot for adding that the women who come to you and share that, you had sex outside of marriage and they cannot approach a gynecologist for help. I'm wondering if this is a common thing that you experience all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's a very common thing and, you know, like it's a sexy, such a shameful thing and it's night. You know, it's something that that, that is done in, in, in the dark and, you know, behind us and nobody talks about it, you know, like it's just such a terrible but it's a very natural thing, you know, like,"
"And I guess when you put religion into the context of it, then it becomes complicated, you know, and then you put the Asian culture into it, then it becomes even more complicated. So when is actually a very natural thing and, you know, my advice to that particular person who, who messaged me was, look, find a doctor that understands you, you know, don't go to a gynecologist that makes you feel uncomfortable. If you make an appointment to see a gynecologist and you know, listen to your inner in-state, you know, as a woman we have that $0.06 right? If you go into a gynecologist clinic and you feel instantly uncomfortable and you feel that you've been judge, what's up?"
"Find another one. Don't give up. You know what I mean? So, use that instinct to find the right doctor for yourself. And you know, that was the best advice I could you for any said, because I don't judge you, but I cannot control what other people do, you know, but you can control who you want to see, right? Who will make you feel comfortable and that's just it. And I guess, like I said, I cannot change my parents views on all this, but I can try and encourage openness and discussions, among my peers, who are having children now to have these Frank conversations about health, especially if they're having goes, you know, I think I feel like it's difficult to"
"Tell her I mean, I think the best thing we can do is to provide that kind of support and do let her know that there's a community out there that's behind her, you know, the composition on your journey with endometriosis and PCOS. I'm wondering. Where are you now and like, taking care of it. So, I'm still, I'm still trying to figure it out and but what I have done is after my endometriosis surgery, I really cut down on work. So I'm very picky about the type of work. I want to do and the hours I do, and I'm focusing more on myself. I call it excels kindness just be kind to myself. So I've completely changed the way I think I eat now. So I don't eat."
"All processed food. I cooked everything at home because I have more time for myself. So that's why I do and I'm I do a little bit of workout. You know, I I tried to everyday but sometimes I just want to nap and it's okay. I just nap and yeah, just trying to have a wholesome, holistic life. What are some pieces of advice? You would give I guess yourself back then and to anybody who's may be struggling or facing similar struggles, that you might have gone through."
"And to be honest, I wouldn't have changed anything. I really wouldn't change. Even the burnout in the, you know, the emotional breakups and all that kind of stuff. Like, I wouldn't change a thing because it has made me who I am today. So,"
"I say, I always say, like in your twenties like I still stand by this. Like I live in a foreign country, explore the world."
Make mistakes. Get your heart broken.
and like really indulge in life because
"It will it will Propel you in your thirties, to make the right decisions for yourself. It might take some time like for me to complete of time, but I feel like now I am more cautious about."
"Signal. So like in my 20s, if I said no, I'll feel guilty, 90% And 10% of feel relief. Now, I feel guilty 10% and 90%. So because I have truly lived life, you know, I lived in the UK. I lived in London. I traveled. I broke up with my seven-year-old seven year relationship with my ex. I you know, I I started a business. I went on TV like I have no regrets and and and that that is me living life to the fullest. I think maybe too full to the point when you know who I had an emotional breakdown, but"
"The thing is, maybe my strength is different, in the sense that I am able to crawl out of it and become a better person. I hope from it, but I always encouraged people. I always encourage young people when I meet them to just like, to live your life in your twenties and just like, do what you got to do what, you know, and then your $0.13 when you go to take things a little more seriously and yeah, yeah, I better I better start looking off to myself. You know, the last thing I want to add is that"
"That if you are, if you think that, you know, someone or you think that you have polycystic ovarian syndrome, or you're struggling with endometriosis and you have all these burning questions, like you can always just ask me."
"like I might not have all the answers, but I might be able to push you to the right direction, you know, and yeah, let's talk about, let's talk about women's health more and have more conversations about that men and women, you know, is all"
"That's what you need to do this episode with any. We hope you guys have done something new if the symptoms that we address in episode of things that you identify with control yourself, don't have any cheese. Quincy, help from a medical professional, the friends of families. If you are somebody who has experienced PCOS and endometriosis, and we have a new website.

We are releasing new episodes once every two weeks from now on wet. So I will see you guys in 2 weeks."
How do you say Google? Is there a?
"OK, Google begin. Today's session. I just want to see the studio. Smells amazing. Some candles hear from Michelle of Mitch living. Why you guys all in pink? It just ended up in here and hopefully it can help us now. Can we please have no real? Do a self introduction?"
"I saw it gets hot and how did introduce yourself. I feel like the older you get in the longer you spend in the industry reconcile. You start off saying one thing and you say another name, just like a man. I'm just here, they call it multi-hyphenate. Is that what you do? Everything love song, the girl? That's where we're going to talk about today. This is part three of the EP on any more pots. Finally. Finally. It's finished so you can listen to part 1, part 2,"
"I feel, I'm just nothing."
Yeah.
"Call me. I love you. Love is not that simple or complicated. Comes with a lot of baggage most time and see how our relationships with our parents affect our relationships. Now with your friends with your partners and all that has a lot of fact, you want because, how many time do we have nine? I have a brother most of y'all know that Benjamin and Saturday. Now step mom when I was ten and we also have three stepbrothers that we kind of been moving in and out of life."
"Sing together cuz it's quite expensive to get a house in Singapore that that fits like five six people. At this point. This, my dad's that she moving out of the house of all the children have more less left. He's retired. So we're going to a new shift into family and it's a good, quite interesting young man, down the old, you get along very well. Now, myself I come from a simple family, my dad, and my mom. And then, this, my elder sister this myself, and my younger brother. And my younger brother is becoming a debt, really, really soon. Need a nutshell. What are, you know, that I grow in a single-parent household, like,"
"They can't find your classes and travel. So we used to follow him until I was like 6 and 271, right? So my mother insisted that I came back for icing for a medication. So we came back and he moved on to the next country. And then we stay in touch by like 4 and, and emails and everything, and he came up there and then one day, he just disappeared. So everything was gone. That's crazy. So, I don't know. You guys have no idea your mom. That's the thing. You see that? I think a lot of our parents. You probably don't express very much like to sit down and talk to us down to tell me what was going on, but it was a lot of figuring out my pot and I think she was also trying to write not showing me that you know, like yeah, that she also wants to feel like she's talkin she can handle it."
"I'm sorry to hear that incredible, you know about that affects your current relationships as well as to be from. I guess what, the new clear, the nucleus family, yesterday when Mom and Dad, then one. That one son is like, you know, the traditional ultimate what I've been blessed with that. But I think it's, it doesn't mean that there are no communication issues. I think with our Asian kind of like background is in values. You always run into something like that, right? Poppy, why Barbie?"
"Okay, so you don't Studies have said that how you get and receive love in a relationship is greatly influence and shaped by our parents. Some research has also suggested. I was just very restless experience with love and emotions is also with our parents and those earlier said the powerful what we want out of love or relationships later in life, in a previous episode of care of the family finances. So you would want to find someone that can do that and take that rule as well. Right side to say, I agree that statement because both my parents and adults and they be needing contributing to the family in their own ways. And my dad actually helps out with the house would cause sometimes maybe my mom forces him to a partner that I want to find the future. But one thing, one thing I dislike, when did I find can be? Improved is the way to the communicate with each other? I think."
"Older generation, they communicate by arguing most time and you know this can cause things to be quite negative. And this is one thing I know for sure that I don't want in a partner. Did you agree that? You know what, the way that your parents can influence the person that you look for? Yeah, I mean, in preparation for the podcast and I mean the little tab right on the way here, I watch to YouTube videos. I mean very briefly do talking about like different types of personalities that depending on the kind of attachment issues that your parents give you as a child. So I bet I definitely had to send agree with because we learn how to form attachments, for my parents. The weather be at present, all weather be like flaky. There's also this thing called like, childhood, emotional neglect. So it's like our parents often think of, you know, providing basic necessities for the kitchen, set a route, which is great. And like, thank you by the same time. There's a lot of emotional needs that. We still haven't fully learn to understand and I how do we ensure that a child is properly cared for"
"Emotionally, why do not do you agree?"
"Do you want if you want to see if I can go now and do you agree that the way that your parents assets to buy for your relationship? I mean, I think a hundred percent the way I like I feel ugly nature versus nurture that would say a 85%, like resulted in who we are today, but at the same time like that extra like, 15% of nature is like you can react so completely different and I think about that lot. Every time I try and like look at how Ben and I also became so different even though we have more or less quite the same upbringing so it's all relative sister Libra. That's why you know, like people always talk about like Daddy Issues mommy issues and stuff like that. Right? And I just want to see if it's not too personal like, you know, having having gone through like a young age. Do you think that has affected I guess? Like the way you love is well, so much. So Ben and I were actually just talking about this the other day cuz he was when we got married. And yeah, and"
"Naomi. That's what I call you. But yeah, I like both of us are always in a relationship through so he's finally done and we love to talk about love every time you in the car with what's going on. And yeah, it was only for me and my reaction was anger and hurt. Where is he wanted to was so afraid to lose people wear as I cut them all so easily because that was kind of my coping mechanism. As like I'm not going to let him become too close cuz I don't believe anybody can see that you have to work through as well. Since I also realize what's been had a lot more of his kind of growing years with my mom cuz she passed and he was twelve and I was nine. So she felt sick. When I was fall to essentially, I there was not a time where I really remember what it was, like having her conscious and president. Yam. My dad's more, like the breadwinner."
"And you mentioned that you and your brother both serial monogamy. Does that mean that you're currently in a relationship? Yes. I think the last I don't remember when I've been single single. OK. Google ring yet. It's under that you should have had a great lesson. Nothing empty. I think it's my parents at the bar. I definitely think. So, in terms of I feel like, oh, you know what, the the husband's to try to take care of the family needs, at the very least. But to be honest, I'm okay with even, like, female bring the bread. We know we had that conversation about this, you know, I do and more than my boyfriend at this point in time, and I think that's completely, okay, but definitely the way that the parent, my parents brought me up, does effect, just like how I see you."
"Do you think your parents? And I'm not in a rush to get to be in a relationship? I think that's the only food you. Okay? Yeah. I'm just taking my time, focusing, my Korea and doing the things I really, really fucking listen to this July because I didn't have much to look at going up. Yeah, so I think it was a lot of figuring out, but I also know this like maybe somewhere down the line that I realized it. I think I was, I had this habit of pushing people with you quite a bit cuz I do feel most of my childhood was like the hell is going on."
"I guess you've been pretty independent most of your life as well. And you saw the flight develop the sense to just like, numb yourself a little bit so that, you know, it's just very easy to like, okay, so I let him the YouTube video was like, that's called the controller. Yeah. So if you have had to be independent, most of your life, like you become more logical and you don't really deal with the emotions that much because you haven't really dealt in some sense with a lot of it yourself. I mean, that just a generalized statement. Now, every time I keep going back into my child to try and think like, oh, what's, who am I, what happened? Like, when you don't have a parent that can tell you, I do I try and you just independent, you know, and recently, we've been having this conversation right now, the family Dynamics, he feels like my step-mom cuddles. The sun's too much grass is always let you know Siri."
"Well, you're so independent and when he says that inside and screaming, like I wish you would, you know, it was a choice. He felt like he wasn't a good enough debt. So in some sense, if he, if I say like, hey, that's why you didn't do that great. A job like that kind of comes with his eagle. And I when we talked to parents because we are so fortunate as to make my information. I take it as our responsibility, to lead them through these steps yet. We are way more open about communication issues and then all of these things, right? But a question for the floor, that you felt was exactly like, one of your parents. Let you know how they always say. Oh, you going to end up marrying? Someone that can do you think that's a lie?"
"Play dance club and we don't talk together. So that was great and it was coincidental. I realize that he's really does not like that and helping out whenever I need it, only about another party. Kind not the kind who will go wild and crazy man of few words. It's crazy. How, how similar they are. Do you think if you ended up in a relationship with him now, it will work out. No. No, I'm sorry. That's how you broke up in the first place, I guess."
"He's a pharmacist, right? So he went on to pursue his career and I went on the person. Why is Savita DJ? I would lie just got two different to two different and the way we handle things also to do you still have you have experience with you still want to date someone like your dad or no? I think I'll be more cautious in the dating face. You know what I mean? Even before we get to the office, then go find kind of see it to you. I'll be more cautious and I would and things that"
"Hey, I'm sorry."
"Thinking about you think someone like my dad, right? That I have few behavioral habits on my bed that I would think is a red flag on a date. Someone like that. That's a red flag for me. I don't think I can accept that a lot of things like, you know, trying not to be like a parent or not wanting to see someone like her parents and how do you push? Okay? Okay. I don't feel like I have never really thought about it. I think I don't know if you relate to this, but when they do kind of push your parents away and distance yourself from it is like it's almost like I'd rather date someone completely opposite of you and I'll find everything else. And also I've never even really consider it."
"It at all, like, what my dad would think, what? It's like, what weather Jacksonville or not, you know, daddy issues and mommy issues, right? Maybe a question for both. Know Ellen, Asura. Do you guys feel like you have experienced daddy or mommy issues? Maybe 40 on it because it happened when I was like six, right? And because of the nature of the situation, and maybe just how I am. So I just grew up very quickly and I think this many things that can happen, you know, when you read that part of your life, but for me, I just took on that, like, rule where I knew her mother was trying to be strong for me. And so, I did the same as well. So, you sounds like numb yourself a little bit and tell me if I don't think she knew exactly what was going on as well, because he disappeared. Right. Was like a divorce, anything, you know? Yes, she would told me, like, if anyone ask me in school to say that my day."
"and I never knew when to stop saying that, because"
"are you feeling comfortable that even sharing about this? Honestly, I don't feel very much about it. But it feels like something. I know in my head. I feel free to ignore this question. Do you think some part of you still waiting? Okay. So for a long time, I always thought that I wanted to find this person before I go married. Yeah, but I'll just do that to happen. I don't know where he is and I still so quite recently. I think maybe a couple of months ago. I asked a friend who has a good life size of contacts. And I said, do you think it's possible to try this fussing? And he said, why?"
"Why do you want to see him? And I said, I don't know. I just want to the one thing that I actually think about quite a lot is that with, like, accessibility the internet and everything right now, and knowing that my name is quite unique. Like, you won't find a hundred people the same name. I want a quite a bit. Like, does he know how I look like, like, does he such me on net and you're a public Persona, and give me like you're not like, living your life in it. Secretly your pieces out. There is even a life. I'm sorry. I really don't know if I find this person for you right now. Like, what are you going to say it? I don't know. I just want him to see me."
"You both, so maybe that's a fuse and the second was a podcast. I was listening to where they talk about how stories that we make up, really help us like psychosis leave. So sometimes I mean, I think that's also an expression write the truth is relative and often, we don't know. But in my experience, I found quite a lot of relief in creating stories are just finding different ways of expressing like, potential outcomes of situations that kind of, you can put it at a distance. But the idea behind it is that gives you a brain, some kind of result or something to hold onto and it's that emotional release that you get. If one day you feel like it, maybe that would help Lord. I mean, I mean it's so"
"The uncertainty I I can imagine what that must be going through and I actually like, you know, we think about divorce parenting and, you know, their parents but allow like missing. It's not even divorce. Is just someone who has abandonment issues, like, like people just suddenly disappearing or leaving my life that freaks me out like crazy. Do you have a venomous? You, I don't think so. But I think what I notice in like my relationship with people is that I think I tend to push them away, but just the sort of like you just want to know if they'll stick around, you know, and I think I do that cuz I can't consciously. Yeah, it's not intentional and I do. I think that it should be that way cuz you know, but I think when I catch myself, but after that I'll do it, I think."
"So I try and send it, but when you mentioned that you don't like for you, you tend to push people away. But have any tents like hold on to people, but I I sort of feel like I'm a little bit of both. Yeah. Yeah, you know, like, I don't know about you, but for me, like I tend to be very hot up about like moments and like things. And I give you upset when people doing the importance in it. So that's why I like that's a lot of importance to my being present and things like that. So that's my day off, like, holding on to be present. If anything, you've learnt that your husband that you put him through, like any test."
"I don't know of Love or like things that you look for an apartment right now. So I've had this thought quite a bit actually because, you know, that's that fireworks or whatever. It is like a butterfly."
"I think when you think about it, like if we we put a number to it, for example, like if you think that or if you watch movies and stuff like that, you know, you think that it's going to be like I said, like I said and rightly have like really high days and they're like old connection and like so many what it is, and that's a 10. But I think if you're going to offer me a relationship like that, but the catch is that you don't tense. Come with once, I would take like a solid 757 like when I've been talking to her, all my friends have been married, got married now and I asked him, like, you know, how do you know like everyone has said the same thing. That is like, it's just steady as a totally different kind of feeling inside the song. Puppy Love. It's not like, I feel like I can do it with you. I think marriage is definitely much more complicated than we think as well. And I think that has Aurora is if I have been through half the things that she had, I would be a baller."
"Which I still am these days even not having you do a background like that. But, yeah, we're ready for the rail. I think you guys have three strides and, and with trauma like that from a childhood to work through. But in times of like seeing people around you date, right? And whether they resemble, their parents, has anyone seen anything like that? Because of producer, she married to that. She says a producer. Yes, right resemble. Said that in the looks. I think she found that was something comes of a good relationship with your dad."
"This has anyone seen and you know, friends who date someone? That's exactly like their parents. I think subconsciously something good. Qualities in my own father's. I can get everyone. That's every girl friend. Come from complicated families. Oh my goodness. It's not like that. All right. Yeah, I think that resembles my friends and she wasn't really taken care of by her parents. So she was with her grandparents a lot and she's an older brother and her grandfather. Favorite her older brother a lot more even if she doesn't do anything right. Like"
"She just gets the short end of the stick. Well, all the time and consciously, what was notice as friends is that she tends to gravitate to guys who don't value her as much. I was just going to bring that. Yeah, because I also have friends whose parents, for example, have multiple relationships cheating and it also somehow passed says down to their children."
"I think maybe when it, let's see, if you're young and you come from a family, where of abuse or emotional abuse is not just physical. Abuse is a constant, you might think that's normal when you seek that, you don't know. Any other healthy relationship is now. You seek love you think it is a exactly. So I think if, if you see this in your friends and stuff like that and maybe they're not too aware that I have conversations with them, you know, it could be that it is difficult to work through such trauma. Definitely. But like I mentioned, I feel like my parents arguing that this is something I don't want in my relationship. So I also think it takes knowing more people and things to realize these for yourself, you know, you just looking for someone, you argue, or you Coral to just get the point across and that is not healthy in a relationship. Don't like me."
"Situations reason that he's always where I guess my parents communicate, like it was a very noisy household."
"90% of time. My mom will be shouting about something. We don't know why. But you just here at the end of the day, but because of that that's how I learned to communicate with my emotions first and then logic S. I always come on a bit too harsh or kill people, and I think they feel like I owe your very emotional. That's why I always get your very emotional person. Yeah, so that's something I learned. And I'm still trying to work through. What does Alison realize that we don't talk about anyting. The only time my dad, and I used to call me to get, we will be fighting, but it's always like, it's not just like all the dishes, not clean, kind of like big, big, deep issues. So, now in my family is just because we are we walking like, how do you open communication with each other and stuff like that, but I'm quite happy with it."
"I realize like if I wasn't going to fix this it would just keep who does not be going. Like my I realized I love is a choice and when you move out you don't feel like the real families and obligation, any more, it becomes like an active Choice. Cuz if you don't do something about it, you vote drift. Even like when Ben was getting married is a really nice to me. He was like, you know, if I feel like I've become so much more, kicking me off you and all that, I get it. You know, I take my dad out and we go for lunches and I I sit him down and I just tell him like these other things. I'm struggling with. This is who I am. These are the things that I wish you pay more attention to. And also, if he doesn't react in the way that I want him to, to kind of be like, how can you come and give them time? Because this is what they grew up with. This is also their Trauma from when they were young and I told this story before about how when my dad was young, he had like the theme siblings, so there was a zero Communication in his house."
"I didn't have time to ask him how you feeling today, and then translate it into today, where I can see it in my brother as well, where they can avoid emotions. I guess it's more about logic is Ayo. Don't come to me for emotional stuff. For example. Yeah. Like crazy now, like and Millennials like we're stuck right in the middle of chains and Boomer's and receives so much."
"Always say like, oh, when we become parents, we don't want to take the flaws, but it's easier said than done when we actually become parents and what and what do we tell us about capable of sending and receiving healthy expressions of intimacy, shooting secure being alone as well as his companions capable of doing healthy. Appropriate and reasonable boundaries with people like this."
"Unstable of anxious, preoccupied, attachment style, some treats include feeling one of us, less secure about relationships and have many stresses such as meeting us possessive jealousy, mood, swings control obsessiveness and requires, validation to feel secure, or accepted and dislikes being without company and struggles being with themselves. I feel like I really am too much"
"Moving on. Can I see the absence of Love Ojai? Be resolved distant. Love it songs called dismissive avoidant, attachment Style."
"Help treat conclude highly self-directed and self-sufficient independent avoid true intimacy, which they believe makes him vulnerable, desire, Freedom, physically emotionally, we have commitment issues. And all people of this is a fearful avoidant attachment style. And please include, you know, if you cover a highly challenging life experiences, such as grief, abandonment, and or abuse. And you could also resist intimacy, it's kind of like a conflict that you have within yourself. You struggle with confidence, you feel more nervous and less secure about relationships. You may also have commitment issues. So a stable of Yes, Beyonce will see. Kylie reserved distant. Love Andy Payne full of which one do you think you read it more to?"
"3218 yabbie. So you are the myth that we've essentially. I think I'm just a happy and confident person. I can draw boundary. I know what I want, and what I don't want and I'm capable of protecting myself. Okay, so next week. I really need to B&D which is unstable and fearful of painful love. But I also do feel that the older you get, the more relationships. I've experienced while. I could not understand the idea of stable love. Last time I do now and it becomes a lot easier to identify to drag you to understand. Not saying that those like uncomfortable feeling, Stone Crock-Pot, but it becomes a lot easier to be like, okay. I recognize you're not helpful for your side."
"Also just a random point that when I was like, reading about this online. It did say, like people with any kind of unstable, a tetanus towels, should date someone with a stable attachment style because they will help you and teach you and"
"Had experienced it and it's really great that you're getting some of that but also because of just how I am and how I choose to be because I recognized and I acknowledge that, if I'm going to drown in a few things, I'm not going to go anywhere so I can use it. I guess I'd rather early age that I'm going to fuck everything and do what I want and do what makes you happy. But that's also when it comes of knowing yourself that you're free. Okay? To this is not hell. Yeah, so I thought that something great. I got out of it, but it's true because I have since my first actual relationship because I just never committed before that, because"
"Issues, I'm not going to do that. But when you come to a point where you just Denville to find and assault at 7 on any day, you will take that even if it's not like fireworks and everything, right? But you realize that stability of emotional stability."
"You stay. So you don't have nothing and he seems someone definitely. I think, with, with you and everyone, he seems like someone that does not have any attachments at letting all that those Concepts when you were younger, but we have you, as well, the other attachment issues and it was like, it was"
It was bad luck. Yep. Yeah. I know. It's terrible. How long was the relationship?
"No, but, but the thing is that we didn't recognize me both had issues to work through, we were clearly not ready for for that relationship. But I'm with is now he's someone that came from a family, where his parents told him. We love him every single day. I gave him everything that he could possibly need and he has no issues. He has no jealousy. No, insecurities. No confidence issues. No attachment issues. Teachers are all the good men in the realm of being with someone who is in a, in a songs, like, most stable love kind of attachment style. It does help you, but not to say that you'll punish it fix you as well. You need to fix yourself. First. You need to work on yourself self-love and self-important. Yeah, but the good news is that you can grow from that. You can condition"
"From that and I think we're all going to Teddy to be more like hazel URL at the 80 grit and the experience that you've had. What kind of relationship are you in right now? Super stable day interesting cuz like, you know, just nice, I'm a serial monogamist. But this is the one relationship. We're surprising me. And this works for us. We're not like together together. We also don't like, the idea of like labels are, we're not holding. The idea of like marriage is a very big thing. And open to the idea if I open relationships, which is something that, I mean, we haven't fully explored it yet, but be having commitment issues, myself just the idea of having that kind of Open Spaces. Surprisingly helps me readjust some ideals that I've gotten too attached to. For example, I always Klingon."
"Ovulation ship to save everything because I never had the kind of stable relationship growing up. I want this lesson to be that but then what happens? I just get upset. If the idea of being together and get married which is quite upset because then you don't really understand that marriage is just the style. You know, there's all these things in the moment. I took that away. I realize line in my previous relationships. I have been looking to marry disentangle when I took a little evil, then I saw the timeline of your whole fucking life with someone, you know, every Day, present ideas around these ideals. We have found it very interesting. So even like not possessing a partner. So if you're not feeling like you belong to me and you know how it went. I don't be jealous bosses me to confront my jealousy issues, but the fact that he's very stable is great cuz he says"
"I just got to be able to talk about everything. I don't want to feel like he's trapped either and it's like, whatever it's not comfortable for you. We'll talk about it. So the conversations we have been is like, for example, I think about it. And it's okay. If you ever want to go talk to someone else, I want the power to veto. So I want to participate, you come home now and you leave and you get up and that's it. And then make me feel like I have. The control is quite fun, right? To feel like we go."
"This is my man. I think about like the other gender makeup of the damn population, right? Like being able to be Nazi sexually intimate, but you can just have a emotionally. Intimate relationship was somewhat of an agenda. You're kind of being jealous. I think that's quite a good thing to have. Yeah, and you can create your boundaries of a healthy relationship. Definitely. Hope you got it. Discussed about the absence of your parents in your childhood or just them not being emotionally available, that causes a strain, on your relationships, but the flip side, right? I think we're parents become too involved in your relationship. Going to dictate who you date as Asian kids. Like, that's probably the most common."
"Type of situation that. But I think my, my own mom was very involved in my relationship with my current boyfriend of us. I'm wrong cuz we broke up, then we got back together, right? And she had told me this is your first relationship go and see the world, right? And it doesn't know. I'm in love with me. She was like, why did you guys break up with another guy? You're dating someone else?"
"Is there someone else? And she was very involved in it? And she texted him and sit like all I know is everything. Okay, let you can come and meet me like I can talk to you if there's anything that I can fix, but it's like a bit too involved. As you think, I know what kind healthy. It's like, they know if you need anything for your broken up, but I think we should be enough to get him. Just kind of come to even when you guys have broken out and I think that's great. So, your parents get to involve me being a bit. We maybe this one is good intentions, but this person because they offer low social status in. Your mom, is always very, very worried overly worried about the kind of people that she did and I think this puts a bit of stress on her as well whenever she chooses a partner."
"Will my parents approve of this guy and cross random question, but what do you feel about, like, cutting out your parents? They've done so much. They've given up their whole life to provide for, you know, me and my brother. I think Spider-Man. What do you mean? Like the kids life apart? Cuz I know that and I'll and I'll talk to you. Is that you do you have to stick by you? No matter what that means family, but part of me also feels like"
"Who's winning that bet. Sometimes it just, you know that I like because rather than everybody drawn together and then you make that kind and you're going to kill yourself. Then you have the energy to come back and fix the relationship. I feel constantly in this battle. It just doesn't work, but I didn't. Because as Asian people is like, it's still in my heart, that can clear everything they need to know because things may backfire but I wouldn't completely cut them up. I think that's probably a healthier way around. It. Just draw the boundaries funny when you like stable mentality in it."
"I think it's a surprise like that also would like a lot of it is, it's expected, right? That you give them disrespect, but I can tell you all and, you know, been that way my whole fish and chips, if our parents can influence our adult relationships in a lot of ways among other things with the behaviors negative and positive and the way they do you like it or not, by that place is kind of thing. And I think this is something that will continue for Cycles in Cycles. Even when we have our own children. How would you raise your kids, different Lee Daniels?"
"I thought what would you change? I'd love. I'd use my head. But I also feel like maybe it's just easier, you know, sit and unlike any, we be done. Can I relieve you that person will I believe that person? What kind of person do you aim to be though? My parents like go ahead and do whatever you want to know who defeated. Yeah, because I feel like"
"Maybe it's because of let you know how to grow their, how we grew up. Right? But I've always felt like the one thing if there's anything that printing. Is there a child? The one thing that you really, really, really need them. So let me. So I really would like to be there, you know, but you have no idea how you going to cut them up and give yourself. All you can only do the best you can do. Adding that's enough music for tonight. We have to forgive our parents because as I grew up, I realized my parents are not perfect like, far from perfect. When you're young thing, like, you don't think they do everything. They can. You grow up even though they have flaws? If they do everything out of love."
"Every weekend. I don't need my parents a lot. And I think this is one thing is is a bit weak right in my life. They just don't have that. We don't even like sitting on the dining table together. To eat. You know, only occasions, Father's Day Mother's Day, both days. We go out and have a meal and even the museum that has, it can be very silent. I think it is not very good habit. One thing that changes definitely this dude up more communication. I feel like this is a running theme, like a medication issues that sell me, same thing. Like I do want to just talk small, talk about the weather about, you know, or what happened today. I want to talk about the truth. It is slow. My feelings and stuff. Like, when I try to talk to my dad about these things and get chocolate uncomfortable, and I feel like he tries through, he tried to call but men's alive."
"Black credit card information. You can find on the internet. I don't know the parents or even choosing someone with negative traits that you picked up by the people who brought you up. Just remember, counseling help more than you think, you know, don't be afraid to try to be over of your communication is. It's a tough for people that have never had to do that in their life. But that is the only healthy way for what. And fortunately, if you come up in the lights, everything for the rest of your life and not do it, that it will blow up in some of the way eventually to recognize and accept that. And remember that everything is"
"Is it possible to develop healthy relationship with open it for anyone? Sometimes it takes you the rest of your life as if something is what you see doll alive. That's all you know, right? I think the only way you sounded like realize and like we can be able to look and jaundice look more deeply I guess. All right with that. Thank you so much for the three complicated left. Always this entire episode."
"Hawaiian the song inside of my head inside. This angry song about me jumping like I don't care. I'm upset. I want this like even though the song is twisted and. Part 2 is like kind of that setting as a fear, you know, when you actually sad to say, okay, I can't be this way and that you're just terrified, you know, because we have all these things that really likes getting hurt about and patri is finding that little bit of strength. Like I said, the resilience to be like"
"Even though it's crazy, even though it's fucked up like it, I had to stand up for myself and a love song is Sleepless, like happy pop song saying. Like I don't love you anymore and that pool. And I'm here that I like it is after having gone through this journey and heading down creatively, all this feelings and thoughts. How do you feel now, the feelings? I don't do emotions. I put them into the story and I like, I'm good, and I'm excited to move on and I'm ready. So I feel like you feel different like this and it's a nice way to end this part of my life with you and you know, if you got any questions"

"Hi everyone. My name is Martha. I'm a relationship. Counselor and clinical sexologist. I've been in practice for 12 years and I will with individuals. Couples with all kinds of relationship, sexuality challenges issues consent."
"What got you interested in human sexuality? At the beginning and have always been interested in human sexuality because I always wondered about what sex is like as a child. I remember when I was a kid, I asked my mom is at 6, something that I can look forward to when I go out and my mom didn't say anything. She just smiled and that sounds of the symphony, like, this is something I can look for it, too. When I go out when I'm reading."
"Hi there. Change of possession of about you took off and going to see so many of my clients. They have sex problems. That's why. Coming to see me, but I also see how much they hang on to the bond between the two of them beyond the sex, and I have come to appreciate how special it is, and how he laid is a la Mike, and can I have sex and once they are able to have sex and how empowered, how they like that, from inside as a woman, who talks a lot about sex. We always received backlash from the public. I think for the most part. I love you, but I'm curious and positive about my work. Some of the backlash that I have received would be like, huh? You called her a sexologist, but she's not sexy. What they had to talk about sex. Also, the one that has sex with her about like, I'm not pretty or I'm not texting you. I'm ugly. I don't care. I mean that's hot but my what is so much more than how I look. People who make fun of me."
"Post seven things on Forum like in bed or she doesn't look like she's good in bed. I feel is it's more about then and then anything's and I don't really need to care because the whole point of me putting myself out there is to help more people and the people who come to me, actually have gone to a lot of suffering and a lot of pain and to be able to have them is the best thing in the world. That's why I keep doing what I do. Do you have to get, is it go to a client's know? I don't got no type of nudity in my work. I am a registered with the American Association of sexuality, Educators counselors, and therapists, and also with a sensational counselor since we cannot attach our clients. I would never even had a client, unless they want to help me, but nothing beyond that. I don't even shake my hand because I don't want them to feel uncomfortable."
"Is there something you never want your parents to know about your job? No, not really. My mom passed away. Two years ago, the relationship. Now with my dad is that you even send me sex jokes. He was. I mean like things that may be useful to my work sex articles. So he's like my, my researcher."
"I'll be the sentence. People often mistake my profession as a surrogate. They think that I have sex with my clients. They think that I use my body to help clients to be able to have sex. All better sides and a lot of clients will assume that oh, you are just you're just walking around like books in reality. I actually teach them a sexual skills without having sex with them. I'll get them like assignments and homework and then I can go home and practice by themselves or with a partner. So they assume that you must touch someone. You might have sex with someone because sex is like a physical act which is very, very not to buy some examples of sexual skills, include learning, how to relax, how to be in your body."
"So for instance, I would explain to them the different parts of the anatomy because a lot of them they are confused and not sure where is the entrance to the vagina? So I would say that this is the entrance to the vagina. It's not really about opening it so that you can go in is opal.

Unfortunately, you have the responsibility of a child. So you need to at least take a few moments to forget. This hate know, this hurt is between the two of you and elsewhere. Maybe you need to ilvl that someone may be quietly suffering and compounding, that hate that you're viewing, and each other looking at a 12u. Kawaii Chan has throws and thinking, is this really my parents. This is really, why is so I think just for a moment you need to put aside the fact that you guys are not compatible anymore and a side salad dressing. The whole thing between you guys, you guys need to tell your child very very honestly in the most mature way possible."
"Without the whole life. I want you on my side. No, kind of thing. You need to tell them in the most Mutual way possible. What's going to happen? Why is happening without degrading. Your partner in front of your child and what could happen for the child? And if they have a choice, if you do decide to give your child a choice in the next, I don't know in the next decisions that you make me to tell them very clearly, but that choice is and what the consequences if they are old enough to understand it. So that's honestly my advice. I'm so sorry that you don't you know, this has to happen and didn't know that. We are all going to be betrayed by a partner on to be in such a terrible place in a relationship is awful and terrible and I can imagine, you know that feeling but remember that there's someone else who's talking, you're not thinking that maybe not knowing how to help help."

"Hi Aunt, Hazel. Hi lizard, and I'm to be welcome back to clarity's."
"We hope you had a good. See you on my break so far. What are we going to do as much money as last year. It is very good to me. That we are going to be on packing today. Money in just a bit. But today, we are going to talk about another topic related to finance but mostly about alchemy is, okay. So, what does that says, really mean to us? Because we know some people chase off the money to be upset. But some people see prices of recognition. That sucks is okay. Stop."
"Odia, Hazel. We are all so proud of her because our radio show has been nominated."
Call me solo shoulder. The rest of the youngest.
"I need a list of what metals promotions and other people see success. As a journey. I'm going to ask you girls this question. What does success mean to you? Okay. I actually you don't like, my kind of like our success was my dad. I always appreciate you. So self-centered, and he came from nothing. He came from a family, with 14 children struggling to eat."
"How to make money and she came from richly wrecks to riches. So I always think success is being a business owner cuz that's how he found his, okay, interesting, interesting you whatever you guys are. Okay. I think this is a little bit, maybe it's not as popular and not answer. And I think maybe people would be like, honestly believe in it. I just want to be happy."
Then I think I'll be by in like 10 out of 10 times.
"Yeah, I think you really are successful."
"I think I got the successful. Yes. You are. So happy. You're laughing all the time. And I really like that about you and us from hotspot, cask. And also tell what a happy person you are next to Mila and Lexie for me. I think my definition of success used to be like Ezra. Why is it used to be? Okay, the last time my I do a version of sucks as my new contact with access to have kids by the age of 28. Let all of those go. I no longer want to have kids by the age of twenty. I don't even want to be married by the age of 28 and I really just want to be focused on my career. And I find that"
"Baby shocking. I I still haven't IVF. Whether it's a good change of that change, but I find it from one you to be happy that my own family. This is my version of success. Right to know what I think about successes financially, capable of having my own space. Like what you mean? See my own business, having a bility to buy things for myself without having to stop. This is what constitutes access just in case anybody. So you can be full and like will you still be happy if you just in case? Anybody? Is that still? While I honestly just want to be happy and I think I've looked hot in the past couple of years to bring myself to a state write wear. If I'm not happy. I'm done. I will do only things that makes me happy and that's why I write. I feel like I feel very lucky every day because I come into the country every day, and I'm so happy and I think about people who have no choice but to"
"Go to work, even if you hate it because they have a responsibility to fulfill. They have mouths to feed. For example, two people, listening to a podcast, thumbs up, really, really, really, really respect him a lot. And that's why I feel very lucky. But at the same time, right? While my ultimate, I think version of success is I just want to be happy. You have to be happy and wherever I am and what if I am doing by the same time, I also think about like, you know, if I'm going to have that device would I rather kind of the streets or crying a comfortable home in a nice car? You know, I mean like would you rather use website?"
"She's right. Right, right, which brings me to my next question, luxury goods. You talk a lot about it but backs that cost thousands of dollars."
"I don't think so. I think that is one form of success monetary success. My aunt says, yes, as well. But why don't you think so? That's in. I don't see it. As I holla, if you like it, you could have bought it and you want to buy it. Sure, you know, but I don't think anybody who lets a doesn't have it. Shouldn't look at it and feel like, oh, I'm less only until I have that done and successful. Yeah. So I feel like this is all of it. I mean, I cannot say that because I love it to write my principal when it comes to luxury goods is that, I don't think you should be starving for it. It should be. It should be within your means. Exactly. Exactly. I don't think you should be like, putting a sight more than half of it. You know, I don't think like that. If you do that, that's your choice."
"As long as you're happy, as long as you're comfortable, you're not in debt, you're not starving. I think that's fine. Right? Yeah, but I don't type material Goods to success. Although I know it's, it's like a bench spot for people right now being able to afford a book in bed. Like that is you do people look at, you know, you must be a $15,000 back at the least. I have to take this like a couple years ago, right? So I haven't seen for myself because I believe you shouldn't be saving for luxury items. Right? I believe that it should be special and writing this so I did see that. Okay, cuz I love the Kelly. So it's a smaller one and a different account."
"The bucket is the Kelly, right? I did say, because we've established that is like 15 case. I want that like 20 key, but okay, let's talk about the first one. So I did see it some point, right? Like, okay, I would like to have this before I'm Thirty. Okay? Not because its success to me, but because if I'm going to buy it, it's spelled change. Which means I have built enough savings that this allows for you to buy them for me to buy this. Yeah, so it wasn't exactly like directly success for me, but more like I want to live comfortably one of two assistants then I guess I'm walking to its Financial Freedom. Yeah, although I mean Financial Freedom is very subjective. Alright. Because like when will you ever be free? But comfortable? I know what just have enough to go around. Not to worry basic."
"Not having to lift man to man. So I know a friend of a friend. He's very into cars and deposits of what his car. He's actually scrimping and saving every month. So I don't know what is an ego thing for guys, but for him to buy that car, right? He actually really has not much money left for anything else. So he's asking for his everyday life, you know what I mean? And I think that's very, very tough on this front. You know, right, so listening, right?"
"Islay Investments. He's a liability is a depreciating as exactly sure. It's metal that will not leave you with a very much. It is a personal choice, but we're talking about like financial literacy here and buy the books of financial literacy. Obviously, you shall be scrimping, and saving for such a beautiful churches, knowing that he had to save a lot just to pay for the petrol and the car itself. And it isn't like a Toyota. He went for sport kind of his kind of like sacrifice the car. That's right. I mean, we all know that you come from a very well-to-do family. What do you think? Like, do you think luxury back from three groups? Mean that you are successful? Actually, before she sees anything wrong. I just want to see you at. I thought about this for a while. I'm very impressed with all her friends."
"When she said, I don't think this was on it, but I remember we had a conversation about you. No coming from a comfortable background and something to means. It's stuck out to me, which was but it's not my money, is that my team and I felt right? Like, what he did something right? Because I have tons of his friends. Right? And it's very rare that he has something like that to be able to get what you and exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Like, it's my parents, my low back to the question about luxury. I could get interesting position, you know, my dad used to, you know, really put a lot of importance of my flesh eating snow when he was younger when he like just needed and he, you know, he'll off like, you know, these Diamond want to hear people write. But in the last two or three years, he is completely shifted. We're now his focus is on"
"Happiness and family, absolutely."
"She doesn't, you don't want flashy things in more flashy cars, but for me personally, write my first luxury purchases was not a branded good to me in my, in my perspective, your money, my money. My first luxury purchase was a $12,000 investment plan because I feel like I put a new kind of like this way. You should only invest in appreciating assets that will work to make money for you. Where is like, you know, if I buy, yes, I am wearing your shoes today. Please don't judge me. I've never seen a man, wear something that is not branded. Like you didn't see on a pair of slippers, with some Scotch tape, because they already broke."
"But maybe my underwear is not rendered. It was an investment plan because today is the most money ever spent on anything. I was very scared to spend that money. But I do regret it. Look at my money, girl. I do not read it. And the first thing I bought was also investment plan for myself Insurance very, very important. But to me, that are causing to make me happy. I'm not happy now. I'm so happy my decisions for me. I am very financially Savvy, friends around me, who advised me to go and do this. So that's why I did. So I feel like this make me happy in the long run but not immediately after all because you don't get to see your money growth. And then, right instant gratification to me, this baby isn't the most well-run. The definition of success."
"That to me would have bought my first luxury bag. It was a Chanel boy, which I brought today."
Joshua.
"Do you remember the date? I bought it off me about it in the NBA Store Chanel and it's different. You know what I mean ever called Isabella Instagram, very nice. Sure. I remember $1,430 for this Chanel boy. I think know I'll be asking small by Mel B Mel B."
"I can sell my back. T, i n s investment and that he just looked at me, but will you ever sell that? And yeah, it is a Good Feeling by the end of the day when I see my credit card bill, Thank you. Thank you. I look at it. I really need a W-2 for me to wake up and just go to work is to buy this freaking back. So I mean, different things for different things because my parents have blessed me since I was young, my debt, you know what? Very hot, but his money, and he work hard so that his children can have a happy life, but he's always say, you don't buy whatever you want."
"Even though, you know, I know that, yes, it is her money. I'm not going to go do that, but he blessed me with things. I would be going holidays. So, can I just ask you, if you feel like, I mean, look at me in the mall for a long time back then when she's been blessing, you with all this message before that. I can give you money for you to buy it yourself as he buy them for you, when I go on overseas trip, so, I don't judge me for this, but you need to understand that my dad came from nothing and run. What can I do? Have his money for his children, when I go on overseas trips before I leave. He don't know how to do that."
"Have no heart to spend in Inspire your shoes. Do the, do you buy them out of your money? Because you really own a lot of branded products. So the ones from like maybe when I was still studying, that was blessed for my parents, ever since I started working, is my own money. Do they still buy you stuff, but you says, I try not to bother them with it cuz I feel like I'm working now. I should like it when you're with them when she asked about old pick out something that you want if we're on holiday or Haley, but we haven't been able to go on holiday for a long time. Just came out of the most trouble deprived in the world."
"You're so busy working all the time. Right? So now that we can travel anywhere the most trouble, The Pride that were dying. I think this answers my next question that I am on the three of us. Who are you? Most curious of what success looks like to her? I think space all our past conversation. We can safely say that the answer is Jemaine because English is being blasted, many things growing up and so we are really curious. So sucks that to you. I mean, just soliya, being able to buy your own Financial plans to be able to build your own business. And yeah, I think success has changed a lot for me, especially watching my dad grew away. Now, it's not just being a business owner but it's also being able to have passive income, like I mentioned. But I think that at the very least, when you first start off, 20% of your monthly income should be passive income because you cannot take on more than you currently have with his meds."
"Do it, but it will make my for you. And then also I think I place a lot more importance on happiness. Like as we were as well, be mentally healthy and be able to like conquer your demons. I'm going to add a little bit. Okay, so obviously we all agree that, you know, we try our best to me on Monday before I send things like that file, so that knowledge that, you know, I understand it. That people out there who are leaving like day today. I like paycheck to paycheck and we know that it sounds easier, you know what to say that? I mean, if you have extra or like abundance, obviously, it's easy to say, give money to make it grow on with work for you. But we also acknowledge people who don't have that option except it looks like quite recently. I think you may have seen this thread as well on this app or screwing around. Basically, someone saying the difference between like the rich and the poor is that if you give them $500 and the rich is going to invest that and turn it into more money, but the poor will use it up in a day, but it's because they don't have"
"Option D need that money, you know, and that's what people feels on the side. So we just want to acknowledge that and we understand that absolutely understand it. So we can do a lot of friends. I see people from all sorts of background as well. So that's what kinds of people who win. We think about. Maybe those two are blessed to come from wealthy families. For example, write that two kinds of people and feel like maybe a lot of people have the reception that do they going to be spoiled. And that they don't give you money as much, because it comes so easy to them. And then they'll like the Jermaine start, you know, the, I want to because yeah, let's see your parents with money. And then you would think, is it okay that I spent on my child and I give my child all this luxury, because"
"They might take it for granted, you know, people might say things and this and that, you know what, they might just be like spoiled brats. Let me see right in the flip sight. They are also those who later on in life, feel like they don't need them anymore because they've already had them that. They understand that these things don't mean happiness or doesn't mean success because they've had them. If a rich person tells you money doesn't buy happiness up for buses. Going to slap that person is hard to understand from Eastpointe, person point of view as well. Use it is quite similar to the things he says, is quite similar to what you mean to say it. So basically, he likes watches law. He was brought up in a way, where we sit in Back Seat Pleasant. So, from a pretty young age, actually, I'm basically his"
"Father has been buying them watch as we value, tens of thousands of dollars even more. So now, it's like, it doesn't matter to him because he liked what you mean? Like you, if you cut it, right? So it's not an importance to you. It's not like, oh, I work because I need to get this or do I need to show this off, any city of the bread because people need to see the Iowa State. This it doesn't desensitized to it. Okay, if what success mean to us? I think this is a difference in how women and how men to see success. So a study from 2015 suggested that women are less motivated by pay status and power as compared to men from a study. And an even though your study in 2010 found that men tend to place greater value on a training say, a higher position in his career and earning the highest salary with women."
"Place a high value on the actual experience of work position in the company is not as satisfying to them. If they were not able to enjoy the Days, Inn book and I think that's interesting. You guys do girls feel this way as well, a high salary in top position. Cannot make up for the day spent at work. I don't really. I feel like a lot of women in positions of power that we see these days to them. It's a lot about the status in, about the salary. Some of them in the higher positions, might not really her fully, enjoy the work that they do, but it's because they are in a while being run by men. So this is yeah, but you know, sxs mean out like, you know, you going to have problems. Every job. That's going to be something you hate any place. Any company, any job. So I might as well."
"It seems the same answer the same as. I mean, happiness matter a lot to me. But if I were in a position that allows me to earn a lot of money, I would really just read through and just go do the job. Even though I hate my days in this company. I was spending easy to three years in this company and then I will leave when my capital and my little part of money is enough to say what I want to do after this week. Okay. So in the last year, write the entire planet was suffering from covid-19. And I'm very, very sorry that this incident has affected. How many people perceive sex as a change of seasons of abscess? I think, for me not really to me because, you know, I didn't lose my job that I lie. I know a lot of people who have lost their income and possibly that might have changed their definition of success are. But to me, it's really just health happiness, which I guess is related to covid-19 and seeing you know how vulnerable the elderly are your parents."
"By the covid-19. You just want to protect them. You want to learn enough money that in a rainy date, you are able to support them, that why you really need to grow your results, because something, like this can happen, you know, and thanks me. We also have our jobs. Although, I guess by Sunday, for me. I unless I see a lot because you wouldn't have you been sweetie. So, I definitely see it. But, I mean, I have nothing to complain about, right? To have a job. I saw the monthly salary and I know that affect a lot of people, you know, but I also feel like with those times. I think, a lot of people started to realize that they've been losing out on so much time with your family here and lost you. I think gave a lot of people that opportunity because usually we like, honey, the same play so high in the same country, but this time everybody had"
"Be there right now. So that was nice. And I thought, I think, like, for a lot of people, it said of shifted their focus a little bit, especially for people who have been so focused and work for yours. They did. Mr. Unlike most of the wounds on, like, family, vans on like, you know, the missed watching the kids grow up for example, so I think it was liberating full of people. I've heard stories of that specialist, that is positivity, do for me. I think we are already lucky. As we do, jobs are considered essential services and we still get to go back to the the radio contest. If not just do a work from home. But at least we have our stable income and that was great. But I feel like that changed my definition of sucks as a bit because and this. Of time, I actually found that people who were the most susceptible to get the depth fast. Enough changes shops who brought that businesses online."
"Enough quick enough to change, you know, and that brings in success with them, in terms of money to me than you or or exposure, for example, but for people who may be couldn't move along as fast as some of the others, they may be losing out in a sentence that is scary. And this is a lesson that covid-19 of home businesses, such as the circuit breaker doing mentally. Well, eat, my CB is capitalizing on opportunities, that makes you successful. She said that the definition of success change when she went to UNI a life with the success of her."
"Play. She got her first job getting you, Knowledge, and Skills was also successful, and when covid happened stopping Hoge podcast and put out the first ever episode for everyone to listen to was a huge success. Indeed. We love you and thanks for giving us a chance. Can you come to the very next question? Which I think is a bit is big question. Test chasing perfection in pursuit of success this joint you"
"Okay. Sweet thing that in the last few years since you don't coming out to work and really wanting to chase sort of like that monetary success rate. My health has taken a backseat. You know, I should be the one worried about my debt tell my dad is worried about my health. He comes to me every other week and he says that you know, you should have."
Barbie food.
"Is there worried about my voice so you don't think I'm too much, you know, you sleep very late at night. Yeah, I do want to see you like that. I should be worried about ya. And for me the health is the first thing to go. Social life is the next thing to go, right? And it's like how I have normalized my way of living. Unfortunately. No, I don't think so. But for me, I also feel like I said if I stab it on the hell set of things because being the night better idea. I was sleeping hours. We have all been denied bail at meet. Me and Jimmy Casteel the night though. I was sleeping. I was a bit more defendants. You would think that, even though you're sleeping 78 hours every night. It really makes a difference at what time you see, someone, who speaks at 11 p.m. Every night for someone like me who stinks at 3:40 a.m. Every night. Since I've never seen my icicles. This. Can you bring my social life together with my"
"Look, so I don't lose out so much on the social life expect. I can see, you know, people have lunch and get things done. I just want to say that being in hotspot cards has really done wonders because with three very like-minded people wear in the same industry, you know, almost the same belt kind of situation. And we have so much to connect on some very thankful for my social life."
"Because I'm greedy, right?"
"When I was doing the night, felt I still wanted to hold on to my social life. I still wanted to do a lot of things. I'm that person, you know, and I've always been since a young age because I always had a lot of things to do. So, since a young each the Lost thing to listen to me, sleep, it's the thing I sacrifice to have everything else. Okay? Yes, and I was doing the night, but right, it was great and healthy for me, the Chris to upkeep my social life that men that I would see friends after midnight. I thought I was done with work 10 points to them for waiting, for me till midnight, my goodness. And these were the people who are the happiest, right? When I shift it cuz you like, oh my god, with done with waiting for your ass till midnight, right? Yeah, but I would do that. You see. So I could still mean thing. This was terrible. So I had a pretty bad. I'm sorry. He waited till a bit better. It's better but I also feel like as much as I feel like I should take my health, my seriously."
"But I think because we've been blessed with like no much issues for example, right? So I'm still at that point where you have any other things before, you know, and I think maybe moving forward I should look a little bit more into that long because aging, you know people say there's a triangle of money sleep and social line distract. You can only have two out of three but we try to balance it out best for me. I wouldn't say or put see at the bottom of the list because it's important to me. It's important to keep my career functioning as we need to go. Give a clear mind but status of my social life of Carlos Correa, rest than social life."
"Thank you. Google. Lady hazel, Baby Hazel. Okay, so we have discussed Career Success. But of course, success is more than just doing well in your career, the mini pops up. This is different for everybody and it can fluctuate daily even hourly and this is something we have to recognize and we have to accept and just a depth to which a face I would like. Is it so far all the we all come from very different backgrounds. And you have only heard perspectives from us, three women in our twenties and two out of three of us are unmarried. Yep. So there are many, many more people out there. So he went online to check what others say about success and what it means, to be honest there. Okay. I think one of them said, you know, in the end it's about a teeming happiness. Whether it be through monetary success, emotional success, family children."
"Is it keeps you happy in life for a long time? Then? I believe you have succeeded amazing. But actually, we're honestly, I feel like, well, a lot of people, you know, what they want to be happy, but I think in that Pursuit of Happiness, right, it takes a Lockhart. It takes a lot of courage to see this is not working out for me. I'm done. Okay, because a lot of people don't have the courage to cut out things that are not looking up for that. He doesn't feel responsible for it or they feel like they have no way out of it. But I feel like they can't do better than it. Exactly. Correct. And I think it's important that success comes in like a variety of forms and whatever it may be for you. Right? I hope you don't let people influence your choices because if that's your truth, that's your truth is. That's what you want. That's what you wanted. That keeps you happy that can be happy. But I think a lot of us still sort of take into consideration what people were saying, you know, which we got to like luxury goods. Maybe some people do."
"Because they feel like om exam or it makes them look successful. I mean,"
"I rather carry a $1 wallet and I have $1,000 inside. It's very, very true. Okay, so this is one. I'm so this other person raising my children to be happy loving and caring individual business. Just like your brother who last episode we actually said that he said it's okay to cry. The cry baby. So cute, you know, so yeah. Yeah, I believe is what does Reddit that thinks. He still recently. I had another friend and I had this conversation. So basically, I used to study and he just came back. So he's been there for seven years and he just came back. He see, he said, his brother was a little studying their rights and his father doesn't work in Singapore or father works. So when you buy, but basically he only comes back once a month and this is been going on for you."
"So my friends are practising doctor and he's on board. Last so he's in the hospital right now, but we don't want a lot of us at this age. You don't record them the right base and things like that. I thought was amazing. When you told me that honestly, I am not interested in what others are like everybody's you know, chasing to be like a specialist, for example, but he says honestly, I think I'll be very happy to just go into private practice when I get to choose my hours, I make as much as I work and I get to balance my work and life and then he cited his father's example. And actually he said like if I'm going to work so hot and missed out on everything for years and years and a mess, all that money. And then for what to send my kids are with you. Let me know which one."
"Commandment by, Michelle fun on go bolts video. This podcast based in the US. That sucks s to her, has always been taking care of the immediate people around her family friends, and she said, this is every single person on Earth took care of the people immediately around him. We would have an overnight Utopia on earth. That is so true. LOL. That is so true. And it makes me ashamed because I think I really haven't been dedicating the most time to my family members."
"Can you should really reflects? So after this episode has the views of subsets changed. Wow, I believe so, I believe that, you know, success to me is really being happy in your own skin. And not like, judging kind of like your timeline by other people's timelines, and I wanted to kind of read something for you guys. Okay? Okay, a four-year degree after 7 years is still a degree. A graduation at the age of 50 years old is still a graduation. A Mercedes that you by the age of 60 is still a Mercedes. You don't let other people bully you with the timelines of success. You are not late. You are not ugly. You are very much on time. So now I love it. So I think that is enough to know that. Don't be pressured. When you see your peers achieving way more than ever feel, like it's too late for me. It's never too late for you today. I agree. I very much want to keep to my own timeline and my own place at"
"Access. Which I think Office episode. I was still hold close to me. My prescription. Says, I was do. What do with it. And only when I'm ready to change it, then I will face on my own timeline. And Mason were both of them just said, right? I think while"
"People know me, as always smiling and laughing. Everything are busy. Like I cried through, right? I'll just meet, you know, it's like a bit of roses every day, but I try to keep it 25 minutes by the time does meniscus mean in 10 minutes about the trees, which says that the wrong train will still take you to the right station, because that is exactly where you're supposed to be. You may have wanted something else, but there must be a reason why you were brought somewhere else instead and the reason you don't be clear now, but it will make sense in due time. But if you thinks like a line instead of the Naughty by accident, I honestly don't know what does lion say."
"Is rubber a very good point and especially knowing that we can thrive in messy and in perfect woman's, you, it's the times that make us develop resilience and resilience. I think, as a generation, we are all stronger because of covid-19 and we are all better for it. But we're done with that. If you are, someone that wants to pursue monetary success material success, it is not wrong to want to be rich. There's no wrong in that. I think that you need to just, you know, really check yourself when it comes to financial literacy and to make sure that you are able to buy yourself on a rainy day. It's not wrong to one nice things, but you need to be able to protect yourself on a rainy day. And also, I like to remind you that while chasing Perfection, just remember to take care and take off your self. Don't lose too many things that I pray."
"Missing you in the process, It ultimately should be a journey that you should enjoy life, 4 Dead. That I think success is a balance because we all want more than one thing but it's a balance, you know, obviously you want your goals, you want to achieve certain things you want certain things, but you also got to keep myself happy at the same time. So it's a balance yet, but"
"Yes, so I think for me, right? Yeah. Success means that I'm happy. Yes. Success means that I'll have the courage to leave. If I'm not happy that I do my best, every day that I'm better than I am yesterday. Yes, sir. I always thought that you don't have to achieve great things. Like if you want something just a little steps every day. It's really okay. If it's tight, little your own time line. Like you mean it doesn't matter when you reach as long as you read it in the right? The Weave that I hope you managed to take away thing. I took from this episode. I really enjoyed myself.

Make sure you check it out online for you, but we're so happy to have you here with us. I guess in the city with us, but elspeth, guess in front of the camera. I like this is so cozy. And anytime you have done in one many hats throughout your entire career, but you were a model model. And then now"
"So today we're actually going to talk about something that I think might be pretty apt without guests as well and that is our parents expectations of us buses. Well, yeah, I want ya what we want in a man. Can I just ask you cuz it's always been what you want, or what your parents wanted for you want to say? I feel like everything that I do from like, Don's up until now and music. It's actually been my choice. You know, I'm just asking, I am the type of person that loves try anything. So, I was really grateful that have like different opportunities to try, so they never really kind of like, you should do this. So that I think the only thing that was this or that was school, you know, if I feel like every parent will always be like focus on school as well. And I'm even still doing school right now, you know, while I still am trying to juggle everything that I want to do this incredible. She is"
"But you have time for you baby. I took a lot of people in general were very surprised when they hunted every single they were like, so did you get the kind of reaction from your family or relatives? I mean, they have kind of known me since I was young and I love dancing. Just like performing and karaoke and is making weird noises in the house sometimes, so I think when I was doing music, they were more shocked that I was actually going to take it. Seriously. Then to put out the music, you know, so I think they were more shocked with. I owe this going to be a music video. What you signed to Universal. No, I think there was more like, wow factor in their eyes about those leg and he's not playing my dad. My dad was actually like, what song you what's on, you doing that? You can single let him listen to time for just a little bit."
"She's walking around the house. I was like peeking and then came back and then my mom was with me. And then using that your dad had an elvo. Yes, he did. But I don't know when but I only found out maybe like last year or something. I was in when I was in the room and then, yes, I do know, I had an album right then. I was like, wait why? And then I looked up on Google and YouTube and he had an album. I think with psych, maybe 10 or 12 songs or something like that. And would you do a duet with your father? Everybody everybody? I think I have heard like maybe one or two. Just like a little bit for that time."
"Question, may be a little bit of a fun. If you don't. Let's let the genze teachers."
"I didn't read in the middle between like 1999 and 2002 and that's the way it is it. When did you listen to Mike Brittany, Brittany Rihanna, Linkin Park at your press conference. I will send it. Thank you Universal, Music. Not seen the music video, even though you were doing it for so long and you can surprise them feel about that. They were like how they felt. They were very surprised and excited."
"I mean you were there you saw some of them got emotional and his I don't know. Yeah, but like that like they felt happy for me and and they support what I do, you know, I think that's what you can. That's the best feeling, you know, to know that your family supports you in, even going from here on. Would you be more kind of like open with them about your project? Let them hear it in the process. Yes. I've been working this year. So they've heard a little bit here and there and then I like this one better than I say. I'm still working. Okay, you know, they don't really like"
"Can you change that? So that their more supportive in a way where it's like they let me find my sound and let me just do my own thing, cuz they know that I'm also a type of person that's quite harsh, on myself, you know, critical myself. And I like to, I like things to be like perfect before I do a little bit, lock you in the sense that your dad puts you in a career in football. Your mom was a model. And so the best understanding because I think maybe if you see like your friends, for example, I think we're a lot of people when they say that they want to pursue a career in music in the spot and or things like that, right? That's less academic. Parents tend to get a little bit worried. It's not sustainable, but I think for her, maybe from the beginning, there was an understanding cuz we did that themselves."
"It was you did it for like an hour and we're all from Asian noodle. Asian salad leaves. Have your parents ever, kind of, any of you, like, a doctor, or a lawyer and accountant. Or she just thought about the funniest thing. My mom will my grandma and mom left and I just make fun, you know, I like when you get older, you should just, you know, just like find yourself quite a rich husband to be a tight. I find my own way to like, you know, you'll be the richest person but I think it's through everything that I've done. Like, yeah, like you said, unfortunately."
"Some like families might not have the support that they want to like do things. And I don't know how I always believed that you should always give your child like a chance. Do you have two brothers right? For Four Brothers, have four brothers?"
"Football. This is influenced by your parents younger. That was so kind of like trying to figure out what they want to do. But football has always been something that they went back to you now and then but for my little brother he actually is still trying to figure out what you want to do. She did rugby and then he got into Legos and he said he wants to be a air pilot like a pilot and flight airplane, but then he's also doing football. So I think no matter what age, you must kind of like put yourself out there but lucky for my brother's, they still want to do football and I mean, yeah, they they they chose what they want to do. Was there any sort of like, you know, because it was your father's Niche, right? Because that's what he did and he knows that area. So was that"
"All I can do. You should do it this week or, you know, I think you should listen to me when it comes to this because I know better. Was there any sort of that for your brother's? I feel like cuz actually, we all play different positions. Like I'm missing you, I can do that, maybe like defend against a striker here and there but they take my dad's opinions and like, you know, thought process very seriously. So I think it's not more of like criticism but more of like a advice and I don't think it was kind of a bad thing for them to listen to my dad. And you know, what they are, they display how they want to play. You know, like I know that players that love to play with her and play with her. There's a good one and then some are more like, okay. I'm just going to score the goal. You know, everybody has different. Yeah, and my dad's fine with that doesn't really be like, no you should play this way this week. Just more like maybe you should do."
"During the muffin sandwich, focusrite. You had a friend, you told your friend your dreams of entering the entertainment industry is Right friend. Actually thought you something. In Mandarin. She said I also had similar dreams, but I know it's not going to happen like the way she told me. I'm so I was 14 when I decided that you love the watching. So many Taiwanese drama wanted to enter the entertainment industry because I love, I love performing. I love the Arts in. Oh, yeah, but I just didn't know how I could be an entertainer from there. And my parents, they were in the industry at all. All the mall for me. It's harder for me to come here. But yeah, I feel like I'm lucky as well because my parents just like, you lost and never ever forced me to do anything, but they did want me to choose JC over poly. Want me to choose and us over and tell you, sorry."
Okay. I said I get it.
"Perfect. But yeah, basically all this schools based on how they're regular. People was a safer to go to the JC and then you will get your a-levels and then go to UNI and what is yours and you as a venti you is basically because they looked at the ratings the rankings of the school's right back. Then anywhere else was ranked higher than they practically episode 61. The safest Choice formula, which I appreciate and I hate you and you can come to numidia. You think that I love and it's very much relevant to what I'm doing today that all she created this account. Just to follow me and like my like my tools."
"Another one fan interest. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. From you was the opposite. I decided between DC and foggy, right? I thought my parents were very, very blessed. I think, in a week, but I think they were not to worry about me. Not right now. I think my dad always thought that I would go with a business right taking over his business, but I wanted to call and to this day, even though,"
"If you know what, I watch my hosting shows and all that my dad still thinks it's a hobby."
"Yes, yes. Yes. Like man, tired, but I come to understand that. He doesn't really mean it that way. It's just that sometimes, you know, when they say things, it's in the wrong, kind of reminds me of you. So right? That's like a movie that like, whatever people may be less stable. For example, right? Like the older generation like to see could do my remind me to do my mind. I had a friend who's an editor. Okay, and his mother still refers to result was that and he's always saying hello from the things that you're watching. I do unless, you know, and I like you're sitting right next to where by the wards are, you know, why is the code it like d playlist?"
"Paradiso traditional, right. They just view this kind of things as a stable income is not stable. A what is a pandemic. It's like over it and you know, you're one of the most beautiful potentially lose your job. So I think that's what they're most afraid of feel like, you know, that could happen in any sector in every sector."
"And I also think like, I mean when people think business, they think okay, if you can go into different areas different business. Is it different companies? And I think that's why I like most parents want to pay the safe route. Yeah, you know, they don't want you to maybe be music or be Adonis up and have to serve it is because you never know if it's going to work out. Yeah, and then after you do everything, what do you have left? Nothing? Basically, it's a very practical occasion kind of mentality. And a lot of us probably went through that as well as professional violinist at 1:40."
"What did your parents or your mom? Have a middle and kind of like your career choice being a musician? So you like this a Hobby Lobby to in which you and also like that I had, it was like oh if you ever like, for example, waiting for school, you can teach so that would help you. But that's why it's when you're waiting for school and not like, oh, you can teach for a living thing that it was never that for her. I see. So it was a sort of mindset performing and then she realized I was getting more serious about it and she was like,"
"Never because I think she has this thing, where if you're going to start something, you have to finish it. When she sent me flying lessons, write a rule, was that? It's okay. If you don't want to do it again, but you have to finish it first. Okay, that's fair. This disciplinary car all the time. I tell you, I like if she could throw that violin right? You have through like maybe a hundred of them now because every time I had to practice, I'll just cry like three different sizes as the growth likely all night."
"When did the hint but because when you first start right performances that you see and then you play, it's Regina, expectations and reality and you're just like, why do I feel like it's still a screeching cat so many men. He's sounding a bit nicer to feed. Full formula for a while and joy for me right now. And then it was trouble for her because she panicked, because it was like a distraction to hell of a idea that point like that. And yeah, so because of that, right?"
"At some point, I wanted a career in music, but I was I think a bit too afraid and I thought, okay, if I'm going to do this, right, I might want to do it for maybe 2 years or 5 years, but I feel like I cannot do this forever because, I guess of the minds that she had that shit like Jewel and me alone and never use it. You didn't tell me, you can study of the Academy of Music, right?"
"Okay, with you being a radio DJ cuz you're not. Okay. So right, I did before I went to study, right? I knew that I was never going to practice because I thought interesting. Yes. Yes. Yes. I like language a lot. So also it was okay. If I have this right then I can do whatever I want and like"
"You know, you aren't you and I was studying as well, right at the back of my mind. I knew I was studying because it was like, my parents would know that, okay, at least I have a bad cough, but that's why I could get away with traveling. I can get away with Trying music. I could get away with whatever cuz then you okay. She's still studying. Correct. Correct. Correct use it again. I hope your parents."
"Oh, no, you you could actually be a practicing lawyer. That's pretty cool."
"Now, we know who would make such a good luck if she goes out and gets into trouble. She knows, hey that at right, was that? Because you have a DPP who fights for you write? So well, I was understand because the guy suck, the guy's lawyer was rubbish, because he had nothing to fight with, right. This is a previous at you, go to the clinic. He was like if you remember what you were talking about in the Lyft program. I said you remember what you have for lunch."
Contempt of court. Okay. Okay. Then.
"Unless you went to the other party and tent, can we have more appropriate questions? Like, where are you going this? Yeah. Wow, you are you watching? I'm watching around like together when we walk around together, people have eyes. Like always has his sister, will be so happy and because your mom ever kind of influence your decision to be a model. I mean, if people are thinking if it was a for sure thing though, you know, I think when I was younger, I would see her getting ready to see like her little like crowns because she was missing a boy at one point and if you were in them, I don't remember. But I wish I did. I think I did but I was scared to probably break it up."
"And I'll see you a little like trophies and sashes. And then, when you do my hair and makeup, just for fun, and then slowly, as I got older, we did like, mother daughter shoots and I realized, I enjoy it. So, I think when I was about fourteen, I actually join the new paper new face. Oh, so when I actually got the audition. So you have to audition to get in the competition. She was at what"
"Does Idaho have an audition? I signed up for this? And then she came with me. And then after that, we we I got it, you know, and I was in the competition, and she was just supportive. And that was the moment. I knew I wanted to kind of, like, take it a bit more. Seriously, even though I'm still in school, you know, I was out. I would be like, hey, like I have shoes like here and there, but it's my decision. If what? If one fine day, your mom comes up to you and see you. And I think it's stop doing all of this making music. Would you listen to her? Then? What do I do?"
School psychology at school. Be a doctor. They would never do that. Let's say hypothetically.
"I'll question him. I was interested in and I want to do. But if they really like no, nothing in the entertainment industry, never my psychology or, I don't know, I like kids. So I can go into some like counseling with the kids psychology play or something. They terapi. I mean, there's so many things that could sneak kind of interest, but you wouldn't want to voluntarily. Give up your career and enjoy. And I feel like in the Arts of Industry. There's so many different aspects to it, you know, like music or hosting or fashion modeling, all those different things play a part in 2."
"That industry that I love. Most of them are in football. Right. Growing up with you, like I should go to the football as well or what you like. I don't want everyone's in football. I did play football for a little bit cuz I used to live in Indonesia from 4 years. And then when I moved that wasn't much of a football girls team in here in Singapore. And you couldn't really like mixed with the boys. Let's change that. I took up more dimes and more track and field, right? When I did track and field, I was like, nah, I'm getting tired of the competition. I didn't enjoy it any more girls. Like you, I was running and crying at the same time."
"No, the only reason that was getting me to the Finish Line with apple strudel finishing. This run is because you tell me, I'm going to get apple strudel. Did he get you your apple strudel? My oldest brother would have more expectations on him. I feel like, yes, and I feel like everybody has a on our family. All feel like we have a certain type of expectation. I know, of course, to meet up to a Dad, or Mom, and like to kind of reach their level, but I think slowly people have come to understand that we're all different, you know, and we're not my dad. We're not. We're just trying to be asked to the best that we can, but could you imagine like in Asia?"
"Singaporean family. I've actually seen this many times where three kids, right? Doctor lawyer than the last one going to us. And it's always kind of relatives and I was like why your brother, you know, the doctor, then your sisters. Why are why are you doing this? I mean, maybe I'm just speaking for it also myself, right? I don't want to like, jump ahead of anyone. But I feel like these people who you think are living like lies to the less stable and things like that. But I think there's a few ones, you know, sometimes you're doing something that I did. A lot of people who go to work everyday and they're so happy that they get to do what they want to do. I'm lucky. I need to go visiting my brother, peace, never make fun of my job, and that gas so proud of me. So I'm thankful. Very blessed."
"In accounting. What when, when you was talking about that when I went in to family gatherings or something, because of the questions, they would on a psycho. How are you emailing or like, what are you doing now? And that was the question. I was actually kind of afraid of when I was younger cuz that would be like, saying I was still schooling and I told him and I was like, I haven't backing, that will get me support. That's why I always felt like I needed a supportive, like, background of my psychology cuz they'll be more interested in letting you know, cuz I felt like if I didn't want things to be like,"
"But of course, with my mom, they will understand that but still, I felt like, is that not enough or right when we got kosher? I guess that's why I'm also doing music for on Monday. You feel like you have to look at you like to do."
"We have so much to discuss the other day because I'm in mine and his background in Psychology. So we're actually going to go to a pot doodle, make me, listen next episode."
"Good morning team, but every other day."
"We're bad stuff. Alafia. We have a whole new set. We are addressing a whole you but yeah, yeah, we're like the conversation that we're going to be having with you meant. So sensitive talking about female Breadwinners. What's your favorite kind of bread? Salvador?"
So now it comes to the ladies adding more than your partner.
"Okay, I see how many trees do on this again. 21-year. Okay, why maybe, because I'm flexible. Let me know. We have like a fixed salary on the sleeve for radio, but we have other sources of income, right? Yeah. It's a cheating ass about my boyfriend, has his own production company and it's only been running for about 45 years."
"Nobody want to see. They were eating grass. They had no income. They don't take any money. I really believe us that night, and I love him for this. You know, now the company starting up Jewel Productions, and I'm very happy for them. But my career has also taken flight line for years. So, I think in terms of a stable income, mine is more stable and Ivy Mansion outside and get engagement. They bring an extra income for people like this exercise, you know, comes from many different streams. I believe I'm running a bit more than him is a little sad to say that he's saving more than me, okay."
I don't know. How how how guys do it every other day.
"Yeah, I think personally, as well as yet as well. Seem like it's also a businessman selling cars right now. I think he's always been very ambitious. He's always wanted to start like his own business and not like that and I was there with him from the start. It's been about 3 years. Now, you're helping set up all of his business and all that is already a big surprise to me. I'm more than him because he is a business owner and it's very, very difficult for them to. You don't make a lot of money in the first few years. I just breaking even if little profit, but I don't think that it like, emasculate him. Lol. I mean to him, he has it before to me, that he grew up with his parents telling him that a male has to be the breadwinner them under what condition are correct, but I think he is"
Definitely. He definitely wants to provide for me but he does not feel less of a man eating less than me and that could very well shift in a couple of years. It is fine. But let me ask him if he Minds that you are more than him.
"So will you feel stress if I owe more money than you stress thing? If you are not more than anything, but I feel like that. You said a guy shoot minimally have a decent salary so that I can provide a comfortable level of living for him and his"
"So, what Jordan say it was similar to a surface 3 with no proud of you?"
"Yeah, but I'm very happy to hear him say this lot. And we can always write happy that you had some gigs or, like, some posting, some evidence missable My Chauffeur will be. No, my God. I'm so proud of you. He will always be happy for me. But then when I told him that I'm recording of podcast based on this topic, right?"
Who is the woman and a man in a relationship ends the same amount of money?
Which part of Singapore. Do you think they'll be most likely to stay in wrong?
"Yes, I know what? I'm going to put one. Okay. Okay, so give up the Commonwealth."
And then I go on set and then the director.
You are area.
"Hey, what's up? Welcome to another episode of Men explain today. We have been carrying. My name is Benjamin. Can I sing songs? And I have never ever Photoshop my butt. And today's episode is a beauty standards for the longest time. Do men also experience, this, we're going to find out and been is probably one of the best people to fill me in about this very happy that it's covid season or was, you know, heavy cover season. So I could let myself go a little bit Rich. How's married life? I want to thank you for helping me with a proposal that one time."
"Help me set up a very nervous dinner date with the parents. For, I had to ask that, was the more nervous thing getting my stuff over there. Like, he was a beauty, send it to something that I feel, I maybe will feel more of it in the media industry. I don't know if you agree with me on that, try to talk around it and try to talk about whatever you think it means that the most identifiable metric for us is how you look, right? Even if it's not something about how you look, that's what people talk about a lot when they, when they, you don't have the names of media personalities on the Ellipsis as unavoidable. It's kind of awful. And so, even if you didn't start out prioritizing it, you you do think about it eventually. When it comes,"
"Do clients or agencies? They can't help. But also scroll through your so silly. I think it's obviously different in and the acting world is opposed to that say the social media world was acting. Obviously, if you don't get the cake, sometimes you tell yourself. I'm just not right for the pot. They were looking for someone a bit different than and then you can make a career out of looking at 7 way here to like this vision of how you should look like, I think as long as you develop a Persona or not Stalin looking, and you put serious effort and thought into it, I think you can be rewarded for that as well. So, little bit different but in general, I would say"
"Very, very sad since a kitten has it right? Every conscious like when it came through. Taking the photos and videos of the birth of my Instagram, for example of for you online change dramatically over a year and some sleep or how I am deceived online. Is everything is that? It is a barometer that that gets you work. If you are in this, you know, line of obviously, so if you do end up paying a lot of attention to it, I definitely changed a lot with all my PS and I recognize the change before I would only smile the sitting room camera and now I have to think of different ways to pose and all that stuff. Did you do feel the same way? Definitely became unconscious I think."
My first-ever post was on Israel to something terrible right now.
"Play some hipster bullshit picture with some love love. That was a pleasure to also get better pictures, you know, or do you look like you're suitable for radio? No, no, no. No. No, what do you mean? He put a face to whoever's on a picture of resent, the boy, even when you go to the store cuz you might be shooting this and that and your enemy thinks now, we must Embrace social media, Kera radio, and then I was yesterday, YouTube."
"It has changed. Do you think men or women get judged harshly when it comes to looks especially online as judgment on both sides and it happens? I think in different Arenas, but for sure, for sure, women get it much worse. I think thanks to the crushing, patriarchy. And I will come and massage my language, and the fact that it for centuries men have been favored and being seen as world leaders in a policy makers, and dip in church very differently. Rice bowl, out of going to stop the women, obviously, historically will put to the sidelines, right? And focus on that way hacha even today, that's not to say that men don't get judged, but you can definitely feel the difference mean just a confession. Okay, like girls also a guilty."
"Of objectifying man, sometimes I'm just going to put it out there. Okay, since we're having honest conversation, as much as obviously it is seen, I guess from the men's side a little bit more online, but there is I think women we take a lot of time to get ready before we start the day before we got to look, you know, presentable and all that so far as even cuz we have to shoot. I don't know if him and do. How long do you take to get rid of the morning as you can tell in about 10 minutes, so be ready at 5, so 5 minutes, 10 minutes."
"I'm so just have taken our that's okay. That case. What is your definition of attractiveness? My wife? That's the right answer for this occasion. I was about to say to what makes near me attractive, type or II value attractiveness, over the other works for you. I think not being so serious with and having fun. Because yeah, if you if you're not, so cut up about how you look all the time or you want to try something different. I think I I love to see that kind of creativity."
"Decoration is beautiful hair, beautiful eyes and guys are three muscular and tall and I don't know whatever it is that they you know used to stay in the past. Also, like did you ever feel have you ever felt insecure men don't have the kind of avenues to talk about it. I'll let you know. If it's harder to press that button with other April of toxic masculinity. I wear that. Yeah, it wasn't a big deal for me until I think it was made a big deal for me to my hype has been nothing for me. I'm not like, I don't think I'm really shut out all I'm about 17 3, which is like, Irish below average. Thank you. I am glad to be normal, and she just told me she won't anymore because I got you also knowing that I'm being a very healthy. Social cultural space is"
"Really a bubble in Singapore. Can we have a conversation? That, you know, I think a lot of LPS that have healthy conversations but outside General conversations in this country or outside or it's not the same. I wish I was in this what school when I was younger and I'm about I was one of the shoulders in the fastest growing up. I was the shortest kid on the team and I was made very aware of it and they would tease me incessantly and not creatively like the best since I was and I was like, guys Spears into the Sean May"
"Call it and you don't understand why guys are so upset over this and started asking me about it. And I was like, are you okay, you know, I was on our own has to learn how to read check things that they don't, they should not have control in shackles of us into the industry. You don't have to admit, right? I felt the need to wear that heals all the time. When I went to like underwear. She was a whole days at Old odor."
"If indeed, we have a plan come out here, it was so sad because I wouldn't have a few comfortable just walking up to an event in sneakers. And when I did the amount of comments that I got from people who like it was just back to back like, for reals, cuz I think it was so used to me like having some extra height or like you just woke up and then I remember not going to name the celebrity but this guy that you know, that's not from a bat."
"Hey, Tony, where are you? Oh my God, I don't even know you that well, and you're the tenth person. Yeah, we can laugh about it now, but I think at the point, I was like, kind of, like, you brush it off. But also. So how did you then get over this whole? This whole feeling a different? Yeah. I'm going to write a few months ago. Again. I was just rude and like and you know how it is."
"The way I was one guy in a bunch of guys and all these guys work guys still like super likes, supermodel fellas. And a I got a comment from the hairdresser that like your hair is thinning out and you look at the camera."
"You are scary, but then I saw the spread and then everyone else look like a freaking green garden. Chiseled, jawline, cut paper kites into a shoot and you're like positive. And you're like, I'm going to say this and it's just these small little Cummins that likes would have chipped away at you. And then you don't feel your best video in front of the camera. And then you lose the moment, right? Or you lose that the Jew or whatever it is or the vibe. And that just mean he's away at you all. So it's easier said than done obviously to ignore these things and we both are they privileged and Rihanna position of ease. And we have work that comes to us for how we looking at. Understand. It could be extremely difficult for people out there and my homeboy facing insecurities that that you can't even begin to."
"Cuz once you do, you are legitimizing that pain and that security. So I totally understand. I do want to make it to assume it's that easy to get over, you know, because in an industry like this is saturated and you're being compared to a lot of others, right? In a very small space. So I think it's why we are not to realizing other sorts of insecurities and other other elements under this topic. I think it's just heightened or you know, I am precise more in our industry and that's why it possibly it to where you faster. On that note do the Y is like you do in the locker room or in your wherever you guys are. Okay, the whole locker room. Think I'd like with men and their sizes of different appendages."
"X, a small appendage was considered beautiful. Okay. I know this is a bit kind of like kind of gross, but it does A better ending to the store."
"Okay, back then obviously in ancient Greece and Medieval Times in the Renaissance. Why you see statues with such small? Is because that was loaded as as as, as the ideal aesthetic because it signify 12th. Yeah, so that appendages, Waseem is Primal out of control, see this changed over time, but you can definitely draw parallels to the, the female figure of the past as well as was, because it was a sign of of health and prosperity and see that that change of a time as well because them decided to few obviously obesity as unhealthy. Yeah, but back then, that was the beauty standard like"
"Is always shifting and, you know, along the way, it should fit to Rio being skinny like a and in the 60s or what like Twiggy and stuff like that. Like yeah, see all these like modeling shows for example, if they're all after a certain way until I think up until the recent few years, you know, obviously everyone's trying to be a bit more inclusive as well. And I think it's a great thing. You know, who's to say this? This girl is a model to you and not to me or knows when it's supposed to say whether or not each Century had been Tipping Point seven point of the Jumping, the Shark moment where they went. Okay, enough is enough. We need to start thinking that way. If the needle went the other way, you know, I'm saying because actually looking healthy is is the goal. And then to what point, now we're looking healthy becomes the attacks and every all have to be super fit into how confident you are about yourself as well, right?"
"I mean confidence is a seeing that I think. Also people seem to think that everybody in front of the camera. We are confident people or their, we're confident of how we look, how we speak, how we behave. But to be honest. I think some of us could be the least confident people, i r e s, s and things all the time. This I have zero self confidence. I was always like this. I don't know how you can, you can go do this, do that, but I would see myself at an all-time low. When I joined, he came up through the competition. So, doing that contest, you get in the way. You get brought back at. You get, you know, there's a lot of ups and downs, right? So, I did get it. And then I got brought back."
"It was based on votes switches, Instagram website, the most liked popular person in terms of voting rights over. That's when it started. Let you realize a price that has been put on you or like your value is being tied to the amount of likes that you get. Now in this context on Instagram or is it sure you're all right. So when when we talked about confidence, how would you then? Wait your confidence level. The tassel dress has confidence was 15 over 10. Yeah. It's very Primal. Instinct. For example, like in response to to treat right leg response to how much like it needs a stimulus and for us."
"Let me get a post that as a lot, like, Fiesta and lies. Why they dispose get more likes yet because I was just in the way, I paid more attention to my pores are bisexual eyes, myself. And then that becomes an EZ bait, right? And then everyone's not doing, okay. I have to do it as well. And then it's a vicious cycle. You can see the machine happening and you don't do is actually this quotes from Yale and I'm going to read it to you now and then you tell me what you think, men don't themselves sometimes of course, but they don't let their don't stop them as often as women do. That's pretty bold men. Aplenty stopped by the doubt. I think about we have a crumbling crippling self-doubt."
"I want to change my appearance a little like do some fillers or I don't know do something. I mean, this is a question that sometimes being or this skin thing that you do like don't you want to do it to you? So you can get a shot for nose when I was in secondary school. Actually did Google about knee surgery so I actually did Google it and I was seriously considering I just got to see that the teeth is doing a line, you know, but it was, it was also enough to become his identity and when you're in school, people always make fun of it and then truth photo."
"Play the gods punished, but this went on and he got surgery and that's completely I mean like I mean argument is also like if you are that person at the situation people tell you it wouldn't be funny or like you make light of it. Kind of cut off your head as well and enjoy and thanks for joining me on this. Just just just do you man."
"And that she'll be printed on a t-shirt. I think, I think it's this hot for everybody. But I think there's a mess power in in articulating. It with your friends are probably switch, right? One or is it is, what does a lot of power in sharing a hot? And I think you'll be surprised even like guy to guy how receptive that we can be like, my, my guy friends. And I have these conversations over. The PlayStation network. Is really hot to open that line of communication, but once you do, it's"
"On that note. Thank you so much for watching. It is very bizarre episode and explain, please like And subscribe to my channel. And please leave comments about something that you liked or disliked from this episode and Sony will personally get back to you."
How do you say hazel? Is there a welcome back to another episode of calamities?
"Today, we have a beautiful guest in the house. Welcome, Justin. And I brought this."
You keep it on the whole show of a busy schedule to come to you. Jasmine. How is everything been for your recently?
Everything has been moving but it's a nut snow again. This fall that is in time. I think like I'm slowly finding my own wisdom and that one case goes. But I haven't seen that just means without her visor or masculine in all at one time.
I'm very sure you're okay because I think I wouldn't count down as nice as room so I chose my room and having both so she had come in and I remember I should wait.
"I took all my God for all of you who have never seen Jasmine. So go before, I'm sure there will be out there, a screenshot of you in your mosque and you and your visor and see them together."
And is this?
Is this how you look like?
"Do you don't? You don't even, like, use Photoshop and you put down because I think this is about to drop this letter. This is the best I can do."
"I think we can establish that Jasmine is beautiful with or without her by Zachary. I love that. But that's where they talk about something. I think it's really relevant to her. And we are going to be discussing the policing of women's clothes, that is a topic for today. And I feel like you are someone that does not conform to, you know, it's nothing gender identity and you try to break out of it. So tell us a bit more about that. Young guy. I've always loved wearing baggy clothes over size and I find a super comfortable and empowering so that when I started Jasmine circle like the key idea was to wear a lot more androgynous outfits."
"It was each and every ND I got like style this and bought. And then every time that sellers would put me in different outfits. And that's who he like grew out. This is like baggy clothes that I always wear and I tried different things like huge, moths that stresses. So ever since then it's been quite a journey, but I'm also just wearing black color and I realize that even though you're confined to just one color, that's too much Innovation that can still have been questioned has any like medicines flamed you for putting a mask on your face is all I see. Now, why do you do this and stuff like that? Maybe once in a while sometimes, when I joined certain shows, right? I think I know and then I have hate us and them people are just fine. Every reason it and come to you and then it doesn't get to me honestly, because I feel like I know the reason"
"Why I even shoes to wear a mask, so it shouldn't be about like out of people finding an issue with it so I can hurry up and wait, that's nice to hear. Yes. I'm wrong. But is there a reason for this that you wanted people to see you for your music? Not for how you look or having an object that I can hide behind attention away from me to my music. But in his time, passes by with every different Envy, the must keep changing. And then I started that you feeling different parts of my face and it's become an extension of my identity more so than an object for me to hide behind. I think, you know, it really represents what we want to talk about today because as a women, right, we can never win when it comes to clothes."
"You do you cover up too much. People say, you you with the little people also, say, you what is this? Obsession with what women wear? And it's so crazy. If you think about it, a bikini and a burqa are both icons of objectification. How can that be? It's so ironic, right? And so we want to discuss how much skin is too much skin business or personal experiences, and should we really even care about these things. Do you think this is too much?"
Are you cold?
"Okay, so when I called the question to the floor right now, okay. Have you all ever experienced a situation? Where someone at the men has told you that you are to cover it up or too sexy to cover it up or Too Sexy."
"Holla, is that means that you're wearing too little. It's not two. Other than that. I honestly don't think so. What would you tell your father then?"
"I would like a little, I never do."
"Okay, for Jasmine, has that ever happened to you before strange enough? I got more of people telling me that. I'm very covered up Moscow, DMV building. I think to give him much. You make simple, but do you like it? I don't own a bikini. So I guess for me, it's not that I have anything against that showing more skin, but I just think that I either don't have enough friends to ask me to the beach. Like basically, I don't I don't go to beach Austin and a leg bikini and even if I even if I do, go to the beach, I feel like I would have won something different, like something comfortable and into debt. Like I was with think that lady to sound when men it's empowering right to just to just like she would ask again and be comfortable and it for me I was with you that kind of empowerment and just coughing up and Industry."
"Exedy clothes and ceiling, light comfortable, and just sitting in whatever position I like, you know, sorry, when you say that people have mentioned that you're more confident than you all showing skin. Do they say that with the underlying tone that maybe you should show more skin. No guys. With telling me things, like, do you dress very fly. Oh, yeah, and then it is never much liked. Or is it a compliment or is it an inside of it? I just take it like, neutrality and knowledge. I love to wear winter clothes in a place like, Singapore and how we looking."
"I'm subbing in like a you know your community. There may be more restrictions than usual. When it comes to clothes, how to see you at a startup. I think for me because I don't really care what people think or what people say, I'm a bit. I've always lived my life. I'll do it. I'm doing. Okay. And I will not hide things, which means that if I'm going to wear something a bit more exposed. I will not wear a jacket just to get out of the house. I will wear it as it is. My mother make noise if it's okay, I would rather"
"I would rather that then to soft-lite pretend it just makes me uncomfortable. But I think walking where I do. I do get comments more often from people. I don't know as compared to people. I do that includes people are what with, as well, who sometimes give me remind us that, especially if it's going to be content for the bread. They cannot have this and that. Yeah, so that frustrates me. Some dimes. I've also seen strange s Holman's like there was once I was in a ripped pair of jeans and it's like, yeah. Yeah, it's not like I'm going to ask you anything, right? And then this person commented, if you put away pens with holes like that, you might as well just don't wear. And then and then make sense."
"See, like I see that. You're not very sexy."
"Why do is sexy as hell. She okay, she knew all your buddies aristocracy. I done in class and not having too much sex me sexier you do you do you know, some people say you show so much cleavage because no self-respecting it."
"People say you come up so much. Actually, you look better if you show a bit more people say Lisa and then it's really low cut and then some guys made some comments why she went to look at you got nothing to do with this. Is what we go through. If that any men listening, please shame on, you want to communicate and understand mindful of what you say. That's right. Yeah. So what do you think? Jasmine being in this industry being in the meteorite? I'm sure you've seen a lot of people in different countries. How do you protect your sense of identity? Always start off like knowing who you are, who you stand for? And always, prioritize your own Comfort, no trash hole. Sometimes you need to kind of like a death into life to contact and be respectful but also at the same time I don't compromise Who You Are."
"Surrounding yourself with people that you trust which house you know, if you have a team of people that you trust let's say that you're wearing something very revealing and then you have your insurance but then you got working with people that you tries like you just know that you'll have your back and do what I'm doing, one of them it and do what I'm go over the line with any stylist, who try to put you in something a bit more revealing, I would say that it was a communication difficulty, like this is what I can. I stab this is what I can. But then sometimes, when I see, I mean, pray for me, and if he is a great dislike Mark CLE, right? Like when I do my artists to Jack, then I see a small fan. Phone and I do like a lot of something that could"
"Change how I doubt it looks so it would like to have a discussion with say that the photographer was a joke. At first. It is about how we can each, do our pet to mix it up. I'm comfortable. And at the same time, like the outfit chance to be showing the way that you said was in one of your photographs right in this like black outfit. Yeah, quite low down the back. I know which I had talking about it. Was that the one that made the billboard,"
"She back yet. Yeah, I didn't think too much about it. Neither. Did I have a talk with my parents? Is my mom attends, like my rehearsal. All. I got my first apartment when I'm in the dressing room at Super protective. It the moms in my life. They got like, super productive Craig. Don't let anyone tell you. Otherwise, I think that's really amazing for all the young, you know, women that look up to you. They find that sense of empowerment is. Well, that's awesome. Okay, so we want to talk a bit more about the sexualisation of women in sports. I know this is a different industry from us, but I think this is really huge news that came out this year, right? So there is a paralympic v Champion. She was actually,"
"Speechless, when an official in the Championships, told her, your briefs are too short and inappropriate and in the world itself, I even States, you can't wear anything, that's translucent because if you do, I'm Pete, the judges view. Okay, technically, she can't be faulted for what she was wearing. Yeah, and I think of this make the headlines, this will not like Twitter and stuff like that. Really stood up for this world champion. Call Olivia. Bring, what do you think? When it comes to something like the, the pirate you would be too wet something that would make you excel at that. That's the most important pie but when it comes to women and standards it differs or"
"On the wall, and then when it comes to an event like the Olympics, it's like broadcast it globally people from different places which have different ideas of women and some of them but deemed is to be like an acceptable. So I think maybe that needs to be a broad understanding, then General. It's interesting that you bring up, you know, it's different in every where I mean, we can establish that would a male athlete the treat that the sphere. If the male athlete was in like a very short hair weaves. I don't think you could have escaped this as well. I mean that would look even more wall that like a female in that same chop have wheels, right? But not ironic thing. Is that in another sport. This is Beach handball. Write the whole team was actually find 1700 US dollars."
"Wear bikini bottoms. It's actually in the rulebook of the sport. Why? Okay. So here's what is the athletes uniforms and accessories contribute to helping athletes increase the performance, as well as we mean coherent with the spotted and attractive image of the spot."
"There are on it being in the situation is once you get you, no flame for wearing too much when you get for a worry to death though, exactly, but well good music for years of fighting back. Right? So does these few German gymnast play Medicine by competing in the Tokyo Olympics in full body do that usually wear the one that comes out, right? Cuz you're ties but in this case he went for the full body one. I think it's okay. It's okay. I like a name for themselves. Yeah. I think it makes a statement and people can appreciate your Croft more than the way that you look right. Let's bring it home a little bit to us. And our personal experience policing of women's clothes is not a new thing and we all grew up in schools where I'm sure we all can a scolding for one thing or another"
"Going to get in trouble that I can still do. I cannot get over in, secondary school, ankle socks with then just didn't know, I could never understand why. Because the height of my suction not correlate to my results so that I can ask them. Like why, why is this bed? Is all you got right? I'll keep up pain. Is it that bad guys, right? Never get over to Uncle song."
"And then that time I was there. So I think was text Ally something. So it was so it was the whole light. Yeah. And gradually, like, that is faded away, but I could never get a good answer for it. Cuz I think the teachers themselves. They must have struggled to keep up with the rules. Maybe dating tells you like this is bullshit. Like, I really did, they had to go buy the book, right? For them as well. Yeah, because my uniform was white, right? So because of that, after you wash it, while it becomes a b c that you cannot wear this. And in fact, it was actually a student from nanyang girls high school, female teacher actually went around to all the set for students unbuttoning their shirt and their bra."
"Listen to Surf, right? To apologize."
"Okay, but you know what? I I do think there's a reason for four damn thing. That I know. Secondary school girls, then allowed to wear the collar brass because they don't want to attract the wrong kind of attention that may potentially bring danger to these girls out of school. Perhaps, this is a solid reason you my opinion, you know, like how about a site from telling us to avoid these situations that you educate the other party as well, that she will wear whatever the hell she wants to. And that doesn't mean that you can do whatever the hell you want. It's about that victim-blaming kind of Angola acting. And it's it's just such a difficult situation, even not just at schools but at work as well, there's so many different dress codes like in Japan. Women are actually mostly required to wear high heels at work. So I can imagine that payment you do here."
"I mean, I don't I don't hate it all the time. I can see the point of wearing but for me, it's more of like it's a package. Like as a character. I'm trying to do it right now in the family, but when it comes to going to your work, especially if it's a bet and kind of rug, right way, it's not sales, right? How does wearing Hugh Lynn to higher performance? Do you know who Independence is? A very interesting movement is called the CO2 movement to correct me. If I'm wrong. In Japanese, kutsu means shoes and kutsu you with an extra, you means pain. So this is how you two again and where he was at work, how you do, what with your hands or fingers or your eyes right now, and I think it's incredible."
"Exactly. What do we have to acknowledge on the flip side? Look for men, right? They do get discriminated against as well. When it comes to dress code. For example, they cannot keep long hair. If you want me to corporate sort of funeral in this be open to it sandals, you know, we can wear open-toed sandals and all that. But if a man were to wear that go to the Barclays they will also be discriminated against have to acknowledge that for the men listening as well. I have a friend who doesn't shave and he goes on like this to meetings and he's had his boss. Tell him. Can you please save you look very real problem for the brand. All the company. So what do you think about this? Do you think this is acceptable? So my friend chief"
"What's a photo, shoot my friendship? Yes. Or no room. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's a bit tricky when it comes to like, maybe dress code for what and things like that, because I do believe maybe from the company's stand, toy is an image that it going for all the same brand. Looked at. The Greene for is he will. But at the same time if you think about it, right? Sometimes we feel like if I dress up today and I look good and I feel good, but I feel like I'm going to take on the wall and I can do like, wonders. I'm going to produce great what to do with anything as well. But if people come in and whatever they want, do that, they might just feel too comfortable or, you know, it makes them feel like you're not setting a head straight."
"What is done? Do you think Dennis is super interesting point of view it that way? But I think like always. So we just listening, right? And due to the difference like regulations that sentence has it. Almost sounds as if like. A lot of gender truth. It's like female kills make-up and then Mills shoes with toll toll open to what is like this company's actually rephrase it, and make it less than that. Something that's like a neat and scratch the game. I don't know. The language is important, and pathetic like like not specific to a particular gender and maybe that could even"
"The fan is exactly cuz I've once to not to work in pajamas and I got us a man, go to wake me up in has. No, I really think that is the difference in mindset as combat too. If I was all dolled up my makeup. I go to work, prepared to do a good show live stream. The difference in mind, that goes One Step too far when employers refuse to hire women because of it at I let me tell you what happened last year, a department store. I can meet the news because temp stuff she showed up on the job. She was wearing a hijab. They told her that she would have to take off her hijab. She can wear it anymore. This is when they just hit you and you don't want to take it off. Now we have changed the rules of their company policy. Thank goodness. I feel you know, lots of backlash if you were all from everyone. Why does it take that leche to acknowledge it? This isn't"
"You can touching something. It might be a bit since this, but I'm going to mention it anyway, so as we know when the latest National Lee Riley and it's just been announced that nurses can now wear the hijab of work and this I think is very much anticipated by many living with into this world for a long time, you know, because I think for a lot of them, some of them are not comfortable with taking it off, but they do it anyway because of the job and things like that. And then I don't know if you've seen but that's been this flu of comments online and you know, what love people from different cultures? Have been saying like, oh, you know what, like, I'm happy for my mum's, then Fred will bring that job again. Now, we're at work. There was this bunch of comments that I saw that made me go like, really is this Singapore because people were saying things like, wow, we took so many years to progress for what only to be regressing."
"Food City's going to be Alex. Sorry. And there was a lot of it. I wasn't want to do it. Actually was a whole compilation of those and just people going like, sorry, I would be so uncomfortable. If I was a patient in my nose is running to his job or just talking with the word. That means from the old account shamelessly, put in this, Commons out there like it is nothing wrong. And I'm just like, wow, really? I think this is where what? Jasmine says here. You need to be in to have empathy for everyone. You know, I mean like you need to understand that this is a religious headgear and why are you dictating what they can or cannot wear? You are not showing any compassion or understanding to ask them? What do you think this mean?"
"Do this in a secular country and then we're supposed to respect like different time and understand. So do you have people like have that kind of comment is this this generation right now? Like why do we do have to explain differences undeniable that there will be times when there's a need to dress a certain way and there are rules in place, of course that we should have break. But here's a question for all. Have you girls ever broken, the dress code Rule and got into trouble for it. So I would love backless over if you want to show the camera."
I am expected to dress and suddenly a lot. It's not like people who actually messed up. Love you.
"How do you spell things? Even the smells like still got to do at 1. I pick up these thoughts. So if you just see me for the front in the front and just maybe a month ago with something about maybe a month or two ago. I was in the building and I did not expect to see my boss in that day as well. I think. Okay, and then she had to eat if you can you come out and see me. She will see that. You are. So I went up."
How do I get to work? So she will like
"but well we got to do what we got to do. We got to keep our jobs places, you know, in such a situation that you have to respect. But let's talk about really your style and how it empowers you and what you wear. So for everyone. How would you say your own style? Reflects your identity who you are inside. I love my style. I love"
"I especially love tops that. Don't require you need to wear bra like this one. For example, I really love you. I feel so free and I see you. I feel good about myself and confident and I think it increases my what capacity. So I think for me the answer is so I love myself so I can say the same for you to just kind of relate sometimes."
"You got me girl, me. I've always talked to the color of that. At least we have hat sizes, and it's been very efficient. It's been very everything has been very comfortable for me. Right? And then, I also get to innovate within that same phase and I ever saw this quote, from one of my favorite designer. Okay. I'm just taking something of his quick cuz I don't remember what it is. But he mentioned, how black is the color which is everywhere. But yet is in the background and I really resonated with that, right? So I'm like, yeah, I found my power. It is Black Ops it and then I still like wearing late so I can close comfy and needing to go to be me."
"You know, I think my cell is closed spectrum because I go through phases and I sort of just like to dress. However, I feel that day. So I I think I own a spectrum of styles. It's not necessarily one thing and what if I feel like doing, I just when I think that reflect my personality cuz she goes with the flow, right?"
"Good. That's what is it? Changed over the years as well. I think my my identity when it comes to style and and I look up to a lot of Role Models, you know in the industry to see like what is trending right now? I really look at the trends Mia and then also a busy night."
"Okay, but you don't Billie eilish write her. She used to wear lots of baggy clothes. Like that was her thing. And I love that but her and she said that she didn't want to be sexualize, which I understand? Cuz she came on the scene when she was very young with her new album. She actually is showing a different side of her and you know, she is a very call vehicle and she is finding that and Parliament in her own sexuality. So you can change. It doesn't mean that one day. You love wearing baby clothes. You can change that in the future. You know, what I mean? Is I think being in the music industry, you know, Taylor Swift's it that women are expected to reinvent themselves. More than men. What do you think about this? Yeah. I agree with you to pressure off like you don't being a woman when it comes to a lot of female. I don't that I follow every year or once every few years. You will see them that changes radically intense a flight to Haiti dress styles."
"There's so many different different parts that needs to be reinvented. It seems like almost and then when it comes to mail, okay, that stick like maybe just one example. Not to represent everyone, right? Ed Sheeran. Yeah, he's been here like he have to go to a lot of changes, go out to change as we haven't even checked him right now. It and took that and compared to like I do female artist has never been anything, but I did that has big Ben that started in terms of data static Insurance. Look the same. So, I have a friend, she is old and she's not someone that, you know,"
"I actually thought the shoe. I know I have a personal friend who stuff about the shoot as she could have come and spend that kind of thing just so they would seem more appealing and more. They would have more jobs come their way to my friend, at the timesheet. She felt like, am I losing out? Am I going to lose out if I protect my sense of identity? And I don't show so much and I think that's very sad that that's a reality of the situation. The I just don't get the boot thing."
"What is associate like Lucky jeans with a big boobs? Honestly, I feel like when you do have it, I don't want it. I feel like everything you wear becomes more fences. Even if it's nothing. It's fitted. Tell by what you means wearing. It's nothing is covered. Okay, it just looks that bit more sexualized instantly because it's a good problem. Like I think the grass is always greener on the other side, but Jasmine, do you have any, you know, final words may be about your friends in the industry. Who feel this pressure is when they might have to come, do it when I started out, right? I was in the electronic music scene and that guy in school."
"And I think it is. Anyway, it would be me like, five feeling that pressure to conform to a certain standard of how does he know dealership e. Yeah, and then I have no i.d. So I need you to see what you guys doing with the whole living up to that idea of a woman. DJ, you kind of make people miss the point. That woman is so much more than just how they look. Now. I have friends that attend events rdje Ventura, and do just go to because of how did your looks? And I feel like that's missing the point of like, going to enjoy music. So I did invite with that whole idea and I didn't want to write you up. I don't feel so I just woke up small in the music part."
That is you even after the year that mean it is so true that I've never thought about walking into the zoo because DJ ghetto is handsome or something like that.
"Food. There is a double send it. So I think we can just talk about what we've unpacked here at the date. Firstly, we should recognize people for what's inside. You know, they were Helen and not, what do you look like on the outside? I think that's really important. And secondly, breaking dress code sweetie pays off. I mean not, well rule in place, of course, but especially when fighting dress codes that are biased or skinny tree, I think it's really, really important and I love you, but you know what? That's not what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with it. Even if you do, it's going to be putting me in a disadvantage right now. Because people think I should be this way. I'm going to stick to that. He has a really cool. Thank you. I see. What is a memory ocean for you as well? Like the whole, you know, I don't want to be confined by what people expect me to where, I don't know what I feel."
"And I went today and if you have an issue, that's yours. I like that includes. It's up to you. I'm the me as women and up to ask to teach the Next Generation as well. So let's do what we can. And yeah, don't be afraid to live your truth."
All right with that. Thank you so much for joining us on this episode of clarity.
"Once again, I'm Hazel and thank you so much. Is it who idea being 25 and in the middle of this pandemic, like what it means like to to be in the middle of your Twenties, that you are not that young anymore by the same time, like you iced too young and you can't do a lot of this wine song, it cannot be moved it and then it is so it's called 25-25, okay."
About to do it.
"Lolo, just practice."
I'm 25 and I'm staying home. Instead of partying. I don't want to die. I'm still way too young to have. No muss. No fuss and I realize that it's okay. And not know where I'm going. But I'm sure I don't want to cook in the world.
Okay.
"Incredible incredible. We cannot wait to touch so many people. Need to let you do it from underneath my mask as well. And becomes something else with somebody was listening as well. You know, it's going to be someone's like this all of that song and he's going to relate to it in like different ways and that's what's so special. And I just want to shout out that that just means she told me personally that she is a fan of hotspot, This is hell out, didn't came about, and I was like, you know, what do you want to come when I will podcast?"
"Thank you for listening to us and make sure to follow us updates on the next episode and yeah, whatever podcast are exactly. We're on 225 muehleisen because it is. So action, is the Vitamix."
I didn't sign the lyrics. I don't want to get it wrong.
"Oh, you sure you got it?"
Do you need to act like simple fingers or whatever? I'll be ruining your you're
"One of the first questions that people ask me when they get to know that I have did is is it like split the woman you bring up the movie? Split? You know, what's the next question that's coming up. So are you going to? Are you dangerous?"
When and how did you find out that you have a mental health condition?
"It took me quite a long time to find out actually the first time was when I was twenty. I had a breakdown and I thought of lock myself in my room for about 8 months and one day my friends Faust me out and they saw this car that I was self-harming and they saw the scars on my wrist and they asked me what is going on and that made me very anxious as well. So I got a panic attack in public. That was the first time that the hospital they diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. And then, six years later. I had a even bigger breakdown where I actually lost my memory and I started acting like a child, so I couldn't even brush my own teeth. I didn't know my name and things like that was pretty, pretty severe. I got a chance to go study in the USA, and I thought that maybe"
"A change of scenery change like go to go to another country might be helpful. If everything was okay. Until one fine day. I fainted in class on the fourth day. I was brought to the hospital because apparently, I tried to commit suicide. They decided to admit me in the psychiatric, what? And then I was there for a week and the doctors that are diagnosed me with PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. And then I came back, I was discharged. I came back to school and it was the therapist in my school that started talking to me in a way that made me feel like I may be having multiple personality disorder, because I did, I, I myself didn't know back then that the proper term for it was did dissociative identity."
So she was trying to talk to parts of me in 2018 and I had to make a trip to India. And while I was there in order to replenish my medicines. I had to find a psychiatrist and I went to see the psychiatrist and then he said that I have borderline personality disorder as well. That's how I ended up with these five mental health Disorder. So it took a really long time for me. What was your reaction when you were first told about your diagnosis? How did you feel about it? I've been going through a lot of abuse since I was 10 years old. So by the time in my early teens already. I knew that something is not right about me. There was
Not a moment in time when I felt like this diagnosis would make me any less of a person. It just gave me a lot of answers to the many questions that I have about my symptoms and what I was going through and it validated a lot of the things that I was going to. So I was grateful for for getting the diagnosis that I got.
What was some myths and misconceptions about mental illnesses that you once believed was or were true. Since when I realized I have did.
"Who was that was worried that I might have parts, that will hurt people. Because, you know, my only like I said, my only knowledge of did was the movies that I bought."
"and in those movies, naturally, that is"
"An Ulta that helps people, you know, that is basically bad. I expected it to be very dramatic and expected to have a very huge differences between the different parts. That was something that was very surprising for me. Because in my therapy, I would be talking normally."
"And my therapist would ask me like, is this still Gaia? And I'll be like,"
"I'm not yeah, I'm not guy. What is one assumption, people make about you or your mental health condition that you wish they would stop."
"This one. I think the answer is pretty obvious. It definitely goes for tid. One of the first questions that people ask me when they get to know that I have. The ID is, is it like split another question? They ask is, so do you hurt? People is it scary? Basically, they all want to know?"
"If it is shameful, you know, when it's not. So I hope they would stop asking is it like split and rather just say ask an open-ended question like oh I would like to know more about it. Could you tell me a bit more about it? I know very little about it, you know, it would make us so much happier to open up and share because the moment you bring up the movie. Split, you know, what's the next question that coming out? So are you going to are you dangerous? You know me know that I owe you already have a preconceived notion that people would be idea dangerous. What is the best thing that has happened because of your condition?"
The best thing would be.
Self-awareness.
And self-acceptance.
Everything that has got to do with me.
"And of course, that came because I have so many parts of me as in like, so many altars in me and each of my alters."
"Were formed as a way to protect myself in different situations. As I was growing up, and so each alter had something to teach me. And I learned a lot from the entire system, knowing my condition came, the benefit of the proper treatment that I needed. And because of these treatments, I was able to love myself to look within to be more aware of myself to because all my life. I've been so afraid to sit with myself. I was always looking for a way to be out of my body. That means not connect with myself. Let's just be busy with schoolwork or, you know, busy with anything but myself"
"So I realize that business with the therapist. It was very difficult, but I had to focus on myself and with that came the self-awareness and the South love. And a lot of things I learned about myself, which also helps in me getting better."
At which point on the road to recovery. Do you think you are at now?
I think I'm somewhere in the middle.
Because I have come a long way from the person who had lost her memory and was acting like a small kid. I still do act like a small kid. Sometimes when when my baby little friend.
But the situation is different and why I say I'm in the middle and not farther ahead is because I still have a lot of work to do before I can actually truly.
"Recover from any of these. And as for d i d, there is no, as far as I know, there is no recovery. There's only well managing around maintenance. So you manage it and you live with it."
How has living with a mental health condition shaped who you are today?
"I would say that today. I am someone with a lot more compassion. Who is a lot more accepting of different people? Different thoughts. Basically, I think I am someone whose heart has been opened."
"And I think that if it wasn't for my mental health illnesses, I wouldn't be like, this is the last question. What is your name introduced myself? My name is Gayatri and you can call me Gaya. I am the main host of my did system. A system is like me and the all the other Alters that I have."
"There is currently about 50 plus Alters in my system. They can come and go as in like I can get more Altus or the number can reduce depending on the purpose of the altar. So if an author's purpose is served, the order can disappear sometimes, not in every case. It is very different from"
"For everyone with d, i d."
"Oh, this is very nice because this is actually the first shooting of this kind where I did not dissociate in with you all the way Gaia and there was a very comfortable environment Festival. I think that also played a part in me, not dissociating. The questions were very comfortable, yet open-ended enough to like talk about a lot of things. He was a very positive experience for me."
Occasion.
"Welcome back to something private, a podcast of Southeast Asian women, by Southeast, Asian, women, exploring conversations around Health, the South community and left. My name is Nicole, and I am your producer and host."
"Hi guys, welcome to another episode of the Knick Kim. Collum. It is really hard on this road. I think it's good for a female in Explorer. That's my full-time job. And then on the side, I also like help with facilitating dialogues on like agenda was recently. I like facilitated sunlight Community discussions with cool. Very cool Bear episodes. We usually sit down to gpay about like, what's the most pressing of that problem issue? That?"
"Talking about, I think the reason one day we have, the whole idea of reviewing an s that you did wrong with you, man. It's right after the weather. I mean, I think it is something that comes out like every couple of years because I, I mean, call TMS Daquan is true, but I did. I just bought this whole debate into the spotlight again, is the issue of the female religious music, religious teachers, being sexualized. When I go online for any platform, right into the spotlight this week. It was like the executive director. And one of her proposals was that we review"
"National service to see how we can ensure that. It's not a space where I like, toxic masculinity can like breed an investor until I think the idea was that you brought in the definition of national service, and also then include all genders international service. I think this would allow toxic masculinity to kind of be different, but almost, and I think you're that kind of cost something like your shoes in. And I think a lot of people kind of took offense with that. Yeah, let's do all aspects of the argument. I do what I do. The issue is not like to see masculinity is a institution that already have love issues. I imagine lysosome different aspects of the community."
"I mean, if I had some friends who are very like, who had a very good experience in the national service, and obviously light on the other hand, have a terrible experience has kind of Wonder like why they had to do it all fancy. Like it's the loss of the kind of skittish but I think like it actually. I mean, as with many, many activities that you do when you are in such a light off of a younger age is very, very easy to like things to do. So, I think I mean I know about friends who are many different things by also because I thought you was in the pressure of like a group setting, a certain point, it becomes a negative people will fall together."
"Adventurous and they still make faces and Prejudice. And I guess for me with with like with a national service and we thinking back to National service all or otherwise, I guess I can understand why. I also believe that like your national service exam in, right? Even the whole premise of national service should be re-examined. But I think for me why I feel so strongly about it is because I guess in your example, the people that you've you kind of you, if you kind of like outlined or highlighted, I guess people who seem to be able to look back at these things. Kind of like found Leon more like, okay. I did some of these things but now I understand my relationship with it. You don't necessarily kind of like talking about the people who like Glee like, you know, her rest."
"Terrible terrible time in national service cuz I think you probably would look back and national service and not necessary. Be like, yeah, that was a thing that happened to me. But now I'm like, you know, processing and I think we need to like a lot of people have like a really, really, really fat time for massaging your toxic masculinity by Kris is homophobia. Transfer be all those things, right? Yeah. So I think I think much bigger question question. So I'm pretty okay. Because I think I'll hold onto. Yeah, maybe like quite a bit of prove that you're right. I do know. So I active"
"Hold of what a good like recruit or whatever, shouldn't look like, which meant that then largely. I had a decent time. Write the people who got bullied, the people who got harassed by people, who don't necessarily fitbit's malt. So, you know, many people who have like a logical differences or who I'm not, you know, physically as a debt to exercise inside. Those are the people who got bullied repeatedly who got her ass repeatedly, right? So yeah, that's something that I I I tried hold on. Now that knowing that you had sent because my experience is, okay, doesn't necessarily mean that same for everyone laughing and national service with, with respect to, like gender, whatever it is always interesting to me that we we always talked about like what animals can look like as opposed to."
"And as existing in the first place. And yeah, I think kind of actually the both of you can't do that to it that like getting to me. And this is inherently a place with a lot of like, yeah, toxic behaviour, but I also like toxic institutions that like, yeah, I think we're the people, right? Not just Massage Envy by like Reese's or like, I think it is quite noon, right? That you you're there. There's have like a racial hierarchy with when you go in terms of like things like that. Right on top of that. Yeah. I think, I mean, I guess I have to like, specifically, use of like, just kind of like military at lodge and whether or not conscription is, is something that they still need it into my personal videos. I like all grown, this narrative that we're like a vulnerable state that always need people that I defended. I feel like that also like that in and of itself, like I think reproduces against aggression."
"Rather that you are valuable only, if you cannot defend this country, which I think then also that reproduces, very specific forms of who then is capable of doing that food in his valuable, right? The person who is physically fit the person who can be aggressive, give the proper definition. So I couldn't comes into today's episode because I'm Christian. But around toxic masculinity in space. So, so I need the definition of, in general. I guess online is toxic masculinity, refers to have nurse and he femininity and Power."
"Spec's in Fort Defiance like men, right? But it comes into play when the people around all the individuals get pumped even themselves, understand the term toxic masculinity in the definition of it. Because I think a lot of people think that masculinity in and of itself has toxic or that, men are toxic that there are like toxic traits, which I think is not necessary, like the right way to think about it, right? Because I don't think characteristics of how you behave as inherently autopsy, right? There isn't necessarily like this thing is inherently, toxic things in urine be like healthy whenever toxic masculinity refers to the unfair, expectations. Put on what masculinity."
"It look like in depth pressure too. Kind of A change is unrealistic. Standards is what then breathe is toxic ways of Behaving right? I guess. For example, the expectation that men need to always dominate our to always be on top know whether it is socially, like, in the workspace or even like sexually and then get right Zen Breeze. Then generates sexual violence violence, for example, that men shouldn't necessarily emotional. The pressure to conform to that means that you don't understand. You don't like develop that, I vocabulary to talk about your emotions. I mean that you never emotionally relate to like the people around you to your other male friends. You don't have those, I can get conversation. So that is kind of what toxic masculinity refers to. And I think that's important to know."
"Because I think a lot of people always jump straight away to being like, are you saying, men are toxic or are you say that masculinity in and of itself has toxic take a step back and think about the things in our society that are allowing these expectations to keep continuing to see being produced the right. I think that that kind of why didn't the conversation then about like a large as opposed to just act like we kind of do for you guys. At the reception has to be like"
"Problem evaluate break it down, you know, and then write a whole thesis paper on. I've been thinking about, you know what I mean, like throughout my life to some extent of his even younger than we talked about it, but I mean, you know, I grew up in a single-parent home to my mom. My grandma also was a single mom, so I kind of understood it to some extent, the gender dynamics that are going on there. Already from a young age. I also have like a body dysmorphia. So is that goes to that and I think I kind of quickly realized that my insecurities my body had to do with the standards that people kind of reproduce as too kind of what the ideal man to look like. Right? And it's why I always ask. So insecure, cuz I kind of think that sofa"
"Definitely Street at University, light into having a conversation that I realized. I mean, like things like, I mean, I definitely used to be like, yeah, you should like victims in for sure. When I like, yeah, you know people who would like to see her ass back in like a c and being like yeah, you know, I was like being underage things that are right in thinking that for sure. I mean, I just need and it definitely also kalliste how I like women dress, especially like a proper way to dress up in ya. Only kind of threw University like having conversations and very grateful that allow people to spend the time to talk to me, but then when I also had like these conversations about the men also when they bought themselves also interested in trying to contact on these things and pack some things that they did also, right."
"When did those things that I really recognize all the things that done and all the things that I was like holding and reproducing on the plane about how individual cells & Noble exclusive of like, like when you safe harbor for the ride, and I feel like I have put that ball like 12in X weather in relationships or even like the men that I like. And I think it's like I'm generally quite an emotional person life just by the basis of why are men so easy for me? A good relationship."
"Spring soap situation, where I, I found myself, becoming like an informant I did, who cannot seem to have an outlet to express themselves in the bedroom that room in Especial mean. What can I do? Why do I have to be that person? That provides it like it was no comfort in space with them because they rather one-sided also, right. I mean it is very much."
"Space is okay. I mean, I mean in terms of how you define yourself as a man playing for Technic, wear one of my schoolmates was very light. Headed. Most of us are still a virgin to stop biting like he was just a very, very clear about being like, yeah, I want to get laid when I get late. I will treat you guys to the buffet in Accounting in a strange thing at a time. But then at the same time, you're like, hahaha boys, haha, sex masculinity. Yes sex is a very, very important that, you know, you expect them to be the one stupid question, but in light,"
"I wish I was part of the group. Why is this? Why is it saying, as such a price? I'll let you know when, when too much pressure is on the guys tonight for Forum energy. My phone is kind of things and it also creates awesome yourself and your experiences and things. I bet you want me to say, what are you doing?"
"Check flight and directions for instance, right? This minute for me to email if you pressured by. And then the partner, I guess, because of a lack of competition about sex. They do not necessarily responding in a way that helps both of them. Are you not like feeling it? Because I, in the situation, I mean, I have definitely been in a place where I look at life."
"Like nobody tells you that you should come to my house communicating cuz it is very sensitive, these kind of things, right? So that we can say that I ordered but then if the guy is not used to talking about it then they want to do. I have that."
Syringe thing for taking a short break.

"Now, back to that store."
"Thank you, because he's very interesting point about the fight-or-flight, toxic masculinity."
"That you know, people have been having conversations about a really long time and I don't call it that like this at the stations. Are there a Ridgid Andres Pacific Palms of expectations that we put on what masculinity you should look like right end and not only do like men Apple that, but women also didn't subscribe to that right in and see that as valuable as is is is like, it's a very problematic, right? Because you're not only do then, I guess we men. Internalizes idea of being like reticent. I like passive and not necessary having agency. The men also themselves in 10 license idea that the other ones who should kind of, always be very like forward."
"Call or not, take no for an answer, right? Which then Breeze ideas. Like I'm justifying them and not seeing them as people who actually should have a choice. Think. I think it came to your conversation off. Like when things like this happen, it's very far away from you or like somebody that you don't really know. But the thing that was brought out, what's the newest podcast? Me and my first reaction was like, oh my God, have you told her? Because I was thinking in that situation. Of course, I would want to know that she said something about something along the lines of know, why would she even allow her to a pentagon if she didn't want them out there. And I got really really angry and it's a friend that I've had for maybe like close to explain the concept of light constant cuz she may have consented to the video stream taken in a certain situation, but she obviously did not consent to let you know. We made it is linked like this. Google Drive Link."
"You sent out, it kind of brings to mind. You don't find it. Sometimes when, when when women douche never seen as I have seen this kind of light does not just exist in like men or women. Also, I guess like you mentioned, you know, we we ourselves. Will you please show me where in into certain extent or black? Or if I wear this will I be like subject to certain things or whatever. But I think that point also need to know the whole that, you know, when you see other girls dressing in a certain way that you may not be comfortable with, and you also end up releasing them things from my own, my own experiences. With her friend, genders can uphold the standards back in like University. I was working at like, this is like that. I oversee most inappropriately."
"Quite a few times by one of like my colleagues until I had. I was the only male in the second be pleased 11:50, and yeah, everyone kind of it seemed like it was a deliberate seeing where they were, like a waiting for me to, like, enter the kitchen after like kind of peak hours and like, everyone started laughing in this person came in like, besides me and satellite grinding on me and then and make everyone laugh. Yeah. I mean, I see another woman. I was just shocked and just like, what do I do? Right, you know, you, I think people always kind of see that you say something right by reading that moment you realize you just like dumbfounded the gym, you look like that all men, like these things. And I mean that is that is but one example of how all genders internalizes things right, that men want sex."
"All. All, all all are always kind of like, so sexually active the desire of any form of, like, sexual activity all the time, right? So, I think that's also like 115 example of how, all of us can can internalize these things in, and don't even know a line. Perpetuated, for sure. I was like a like a minority. I suppose in that I was number one on Chinese, but also, then also do you an email? But I mean, I guess I can hold on to that fact. That within that, that space I was a minority but also knowing that like, yeah, my body at large. I still as a meal. Hold onto to log provision of this pieces, right? And I cannot deny that and it sent me something. I still need to balance."
"We didn't this piece that was a very specific gender Dynamics, largely. Just even now on a daily basis. It's not like I physically feel unsafe or whatever. Right? Most of the time that I think about yourself is locked for, good luck. That I still hold on to him in and try to remind myself off a couple days ago, by this Creator who basically talked about how they wouldn't want to date a stereotypical Chinese men that like and then like the Tree of Life."
"And I told you put my finger on a wire that is. So even though I agree whenever you do you already put yourself in the line of fire because if you are saying it's a problem and you are allowing yourself to ignore the individual traits. They are the other ones. So you can say that these treats are only present in like this group is not true because these traits are present in many many other groups and that you have recognized stereotyping always uses energy help anyone. It was it doesn't necessarily help you or not. All men, say Not all men even more and who believe that even more deeply, for sure, right? Oh, yeah, I guess I have like a somewhat like a different opinion, I guess. Because I mean, I number one I think something like I just tried to teach myself over the years."
"So so is that I think it's recipe for 44 Women, right? I think these come from like white lived experiences like a real experiences to even though the execution maybe is a bit like what I do that? I do not but I guess that is not necessary at the heart of the issue. I couldn't I couldn't disagree with the execution but still agree very much with it, which I get that is linked to my second point about like the message and I guess, kind of how I relate to that message for sure. I mean, as, as I can as a non-chinese individual, who has icon Chinese female friends, right? I've heard a lot of stories about like, yeah, you know, like reproducing racial preferences, all you can like very like, very very toxic racialized stereotypes from from these kinds of men from your weak-ass. I suppose until I really understand how, like, really can't talk loud. I think also more, personally."
"When I think about like my sexuality and my kind of like romantic interests, what does it mean? That historically also, I've experienced a lot of the women that I have had feelings for and crushes on end up with like the weekend is supposed to like me. And now I'm going to say is I could you text me my Reese s into it. Is it the color of my skin? You know what you mean? Not be true. But that's on an IV. Something that I think about lots of static on a kind of guy right. That holds. I think sokolov a privileged or liked capital A in a in a Singaporean context that great. I think neatly maps onto like the Ouija as a possibility. And so I think that is something that I still kind of like, yeah, I can't deny that which is why I'm like a lot more sympathetic than to like this."
Thank you for being the discomfort. I think that was
"but also,"
"Romantic do a degree on my way to address something that is apparent in the like it's a rejection of light femininity. I guess you. Defy visually song that nouns starting with the fingernails in a couple weeks. I think like, yeah, I mean, I just like how I dress. I want to point out that it's all so, I mean, it's not like I've dressed this way forever, right? I mean like I I it's definitely something I thought more about it as I guess. I guess I've grown up. I think it's very much linked to what I think. I mean, I guess via my interest in my masculinity and gender bomb. Broadly has allowed me to realize that it doesn't matter what you put on. And I like that kind of like maybe in my own way. I try and like"
"Three challenge what it means to dress like a man. What it means to dress like as a conventional guy. I also think there's something kind of about the something around. I don't know. Maybe like how you look that is some extent. Like historically I like that. I'm now trying to explore kind of like what I think would look nice on myself and I I like kind of like having that space to think about how to dress up, like more individuals. I can get it right. I think that also allows me to be more creative Castle just like me. Do you like a nice? But yeah, I think in my own way, I mean like you have a performance, right? I'm trying to flee. Do things that"
"I go against the grain a little bit with the hopes that eventually more people also feel comfortable doing it themselves. I agree about the hype in slavish, super. Well, yeah. Yeah, I guess the last thing to all about conversation is I want to know if you have any thoughts throughout all that comfortable with themselves, but I also think is maybe something that can be done like, a collaborative Leo's. All right, like I think I guess especially for like men who may be want to explode a masculine to you're going to like interrogate some of the things that"
"Get it done in the past or kind of what it means to be a man. Not right. I do think if you can have those like vulnerable and honest conversations with that, got them in our people that you trust. You're doing that together. I think you're right. When you have a community real kind of like exploring yourselves but together and I think I could be like super funny. Funny question is, how do you create that space one supposed to be like quite honest? I think it's tough. But I think it just being honest that you've made mistakes or you don't like problematic things or that like yeah, you know, these are things I've done in the past. I still maybe hold on to some views or whatever but I would like to be open to like actually earning or trying to like, I'm Peggy things or people, you know, like who who is up for that? So I think really works. I think you stopping to play some like honesty. It's is very different from me like telling you like you explain to me now and let me see if I"
"Debate you on the pointer. I think that that's a different. Sorry. I do think. Yeah, just kind of Reckoning with who you are. Who you been."
"I think this except one love me the way that you negotiate with intentional. And so I think it's so cute. That you may have been hurt in the past experiences. But it's also like the intention of stepping over boundaries and allowing yourself to grow from them. My last note is dead. I guess this is why I don't like this kind of important and so sleeping but hold on to it inside you, right? Like I think historically we have recognized."
"How many so hold on to lock religious when the other other people who expressed in, whatever we all have historically, been marginalised, feel like, I think it is important to also recognize that yeah, you know, as much as we want to change and, and, and recognize that were all complicit in my toxic Behavior. According toxic masculinity. I think the impact is very different because I need to keep in mind that it's important. Not to sometimes I get draw false equivalency and to recognize that, like, yeah, these things all have different impact and still hold on, holding on to that, but still like actively challenging times."
"I'll be a friend to me October was just because I really was not touched by it to me as if you have the pink ribbon designing like magnets for fridge and she had hid it from all of us and then when she went to hospital for these later, she passed on."
What is a sub series from something private?
Stories of women who survived unspeakable. Pain zhentarim.
We meant to succeed. Despite an Against All Odds. This is their story.
"I just spoke to him over the phone for a potential project Levolution. But I think I was worth of chest. She told me she lost her mother to breast cancer. What is after she was diagnosed with breast cancer, awareness, month is October breast cancer is the number one cancer that you can still do examination by yourself at home. More into detail is to observe. If there any lumps in your breast, while do we have sugar?"
"No, I Want To Know Remix. Sorry."
"Hi, I'm norinda. I'm 36 this year last year, almost to the day. We found out that our mom had breast cancer and she had hid it from her when she went to hospital for days. Later. She passed on to start this new project, shine, curious. And and I hope this is a story that you let people find out more about. I don't, I don't see just to appreciate what he has."
"So I'm the eldest and then I have a younger brother in the youngest sister, my dad. So I guess a little bit of the typical Melissa me. For example. My mom is Somali Muslim. My dad is Chinese, but he was adopted by an Indian family. So we had to sneak stuff, like Hindi music in background. Play song, dramas, but not, so we kind of live. So then she has so because yeah, I guess I was close to my dad and I found him if he had to talk to you and my mom is really strict, like she was a stay-at-home mom."
"So so basically after she married, my dad, she had me and my siblings and she pretty much a sacrifice. You know, who she was to just be your mom. There was something that she wants it like, like growing up. She always say that she always wish she was. She was a mom and a wife. So so that was peeing. Much iron in a nutshell. I think mean I'm just"
"I think I was very different from them because me, and I couldn't see myself as a as a housewife. I had a really big dreams that I wanted to go with seasoned and then study. And I just think I've always felt like a nice, but it's a bubble and I need to get out and she had no idea. So, you know, even when I don't like you, I want to go to New York. She was crying. Just so we ended up with me and I like playing on the painting and she's definitely orientation. As she would not talk to me on the whole flight, just like sobbing because you know, I don't understand why you wanted to leave and go get a job, go get married him."
But you have to do all the things that your parents like.
"I was a little bit selfish, hope to swimming things outside of the norm and looking back. I love you, but I'm talking a lot about, like, on her good days. And I didn't realize I can not very normal that she and I would talk about sex a lot and don't you. Like, we didn't technically talk about sex. She gave me, this is a, this is just something in our family cuz like she at my uncle's with Kristoff the same jokes and it's like 15 year old jokes, like penis jokes."
"And she's always used to make fun of me and the guys I would do so show called a job like playing the trumpet from that today or whatever. And then we'll have all this busy jokes are resting of it and like talking about bananas and sizes and went none. And she said he will like you. If you're Muslim, I'm your mother but overall."
"We were open to that extent and I would share some of the things about the guys I used to date. As you would tell me about her love life as well. Like obviously before my dad and but it was frozen things. That was still, it was about Andrea. This is what your relationship is to be a really stupid joke. So excited thinking about me and my mom is dead as much as we would fight."
"I'm actually super playful around Hyde and scared. And so, one day I was taking a shower and I have a fever. And anyway, I fainted in the shower and I was obviously naked and she wasn't the only one in the house and the next thing I knew she, she was touring all over me like panicking of crushes."
"And then I was like, what? And then she lets me off and she's just like Natalia Imbruglia. Torn was super, super popular. And the first line is like naked on the floor. So every time that song came on the radio. See you at just like hey baby, it's just a big ten years and she's like to hear your phone ringing song. I'm just like, oh my God, just let it go and you know how he look like, so that's hilarious. And that was the start of the story that I wrote."
"Better. And so the funny thing is, I think you never seen my mom a platform like it has feet, but she would always be into the baggy t-shirt. A track pants issues with a body. Like she felt she was fat. She she felt she was too tall and big people on Syria. So so she wasted her body and and and so when she passed"
"As a Muslim funeral rites, as you know, we don't we don't have to do, is the buddy has to be buried straight away within the day or the next day. They passed on late in the evening. So and families involved. And I think it, no, we say that it's is to remind us of the song. Witness of death. That happens to everyone that's going to scape, but it was so so, so as women in the family, what we are supposed to do is we have supposed to give the disease halaseh bathing, right? And so I didn't know it was, but I remembered cuz she was like, he must have his death in the family. That wasn't me. It was in like a grandparent."
"And it took Everyone by surprise. So we we all went in and and she said, she just looks like she's sleeping, but she's covered in like a bunch of cloth. You know, that she really doesn't say she's sleeping and then I was just like,"
"Like wow, this is real. I remember we had Specific Instructions where she didn't want to do at home, which is actually a lot of people do that. She wanted to just go straight to make all that. Dip with Sarah. We just we conduct the rites. So it had to be tiny room and you go in as long as it looks like a vet because I know this is PB, obviously, but it was as many"
"The woman's family members who would volunteer because I think you get like, you got up."
Can I see with points?
"so, so I went in and"
"I just trying not to not to cry because you supposed to put on a brave face. Reality is I supposed to like it when I saw the body because the point of getting cleaned up is to be to be a busy as two women get around the, we left the cloth. Are we not allowed to see under? So we just like me and wipe her down and then delete would be like, dinner over to pick her up. And then I know they always say that, you know, when you die your body gets heavier with sin, but you're just super heavy some cuz you know you did and she was like like we had"
"Free women on each side. So we have to like glitter and and all I could think about is just like, Do not drop her Thang."
"and we was my last egg, cuz my mind I'm like,"
"I screwed up a few times, but I am not going to screw this up was like, yeah, this is why I do all the week's move move. And so, so I was looking at her legs and why were you so worried about? You know, I saw it to you Mom because"
"Well, the thing was, she probably had cancer for a while, but she had to Spokeo of doctors and when I saw it because the doctors had told me in the hospital like basically shut and left breast anymore, that you mahat Ethan up the muscle, but actually just it had taken a lot of rest, but I know you would like, what do you mean? Cuz I was just wearing a t-shirt, you see you? See you see the silhouette, but when the clave kind of got up."
it was it look like I look like a meteorite was just
"images of a black and when I saw it, I I had, I had a moment, but I just so I couldn't breathe and I kind of got back with my cousin. She saw, she does help me in Denham."
"and I just,"
just tell myself like a lake.
She left with that pain because she didn't want anyone to worry.
"She was a little scared about talking about it, you know, and, and that to me is like it got some that bad. So it wasn't cuz when I'm watching, Rob, I'm still think I'm still at making jokes and might have if I like, I'm just pretending I'm talking to her. And then when I, when I started to you, when I was just like, oh, yeah."
That's what I said. But if I was
"She gets wrapped up in and white cotton and the kind of cover-up and then I could hear her voice in my head going to make things. All right, how it really was. Have I want to see it."
"Cuz it was exactly what she was saying that she just like, like, if you know what I mean? Yeah, I was still crying my eyes out in."
"And I was so tired, but I felt like I would jokes kept us going and then they put it on the tank and I'm sorry. And they put some perfume and then that was it. And then and then yeah, or when, when it was all done to me. She was just beautiful. Rachel is gorgeous, but she had to stuff her nostrils with the cotton and when they was in fact, she said and that's when does when I had to leave the room in and everyone else came in to kiss her and everything. And I was like, I came in late again to to kiss her before date, they had to rest but the hottest thing I've ever done."
I was so. So you asked me to do it. I would do it again and again.
"I mean, I never really understood it at first, but it felt like closure."
Doesn't sound like just being in my mind this time.
It was an honor to do that.
"So yes, I wrote about it. I didn't think about it that right now as I was going to ask you to elaborate on when you realize that something wrong with her."
"Tell my mom, like I said, she was just very moody, but she also said it's right. So she will not do what she does in her room and she'll say or she will sweat it out. Lots of water is back to normal physically strong. So, like, how many weeks before she was a bit run-down, and she was just hide out in a room and then that my sister and I, we just talk shows, you pressed possess you staying at my boyfriend's and I'll come back home once in awhile. So Den."
"What had happened was so I was coming back home and I think my sister must have texted me or something and she just ate money's really sick. So I'm like, okay, cuz sometimes she would listen to me. And yes, she was hiding on the dock and I sent on the lights and I could see. She was just like sweating and she just wouldn't want cuz she would just lie. I want Edition and and I'm just say, like, what's wrong. I just like nothing. I'm just, I'll be fine. I'll be fine. And then I told her like she can message that says that you want to see an ambulance, what's wrong and you want to go to the doctor now. She's just like"
"No, no, no. No, but well you're here. I need to talk to you. So I said, okay."
"And she gets a piece of paper and she got stuck just like stack of cash. I just like, call this person. Tell them you want dis dis dis, it's all inclusive. I'm just like, what are you talkin about? And she's just like"
"Just listen to me. So I say like then then that's what I'm just like. Oh, fuck, like something something, something serious. I think I'm going to go."
"Cuz anything to write the last time I seen the last five years, she's already sick that she feels. She has a feeling that she's going to pass at the age of eight 61 and my grandpa died. So she's supposed to call. I want to call an ambulance that day that I was just wait till Sunday. My brother Mexico because she's past her favorite child is. So I'm just like, I didn't you have to come down. Mommy is really sick. She refuses to get into an ambulance. So I think you need to tell her."
"So cuz he shows up, you shows up the next day and then my dad, my dad doesn't that he and my mom. So my dad comes home."
"And the thing was my mama's mean. Did you call him unlike? No, no one called him. My mom didn't call you. My dad. Doesn't you? And he came back? And he's like, mommy's sick. Is it? I'm like, yeah, music, Sunday."
"Sunday like 5 p.m. So that was a big production cuz everyone finally home to the hospital. And no one knew what was wrong with her. She refuses to see, you just know, she's sweating. She's really sunken cheeks and everything and she does, she could not talk if you can meet. So, so, tender ambulance came, and she"
"Only letter that the woman paramedic, she won't, but still very mysterious and they did something wrong, which is really close to my house. And so we went straight to e.r. Thing and then, just let me check to come in the next day. Or so. Then the next day we came in and gave we had no idea was wrong when I saw her. She was, she was, she was, she looked a bit help you but she was offended job, and she, that's why she said, she said, the doctor says my breath."
"I want you girls to get your eyes checked out. Don't be like me, you know."
"Don't wait till the last minute. Reschedule has nothing to be scared off. And it shows they can't really good spirits too, cuz she got really excited and then do the checkouts and this morning that what they had like around of intense coming over to check me out. She said that in my mind, but to me, I'm like I ran out of incest came in to check you out and it's really a case that they'd never seen before. But describing that they basically asked her to send you a text and I'm like"
Can I see something wrong? So then it ended up this wants it to see us and basically I kind of took over the role of slime.
"The parent. Yeah, cuz my dad my dad emotionally was she was distraught. It was just so he was him in my mom and he was just comforting her. And so we had to deal with like the actual like what's going on. So it ended up this like, I'm sorry, but she has a tumor. The reason she's sick is because her human has ruptured, she had been bleeding and so they what they were doing like going to go in and then do the skins and everything cuz he want to see how fight spread. So"
"And it just takes awhile. So they'll probably know more after this and everything and we would notice. But we're just like, I know everyone gets. We just a technology is great sign. Says, breathe, don't fix everything but that was a lot of things. I just felt like, I feel like shit. I feel like a shity. Therefore not hearing it for the first night. She went, did she stick to me?"
Whatever you find. I'm so sorry. I'm so so sorry.
"On my way talking about she's like, I'm so sorry that I got them and we're cleaning up her room and under debate. Does this pile of t-shirts?"
"When I pulled it out, it was just like it was soaked with blood and pus, because that's how she was hiding it. She wear a T-shirt and because it seemed I had to drop ship. It was soaked in Blood and she was a change, starting to change, and slide it under and because she was in her cave and wouldn't come up, we because we never know. So I was washing it now. He's crying and stressing. I'm like, I mean I was cussing because I was just I feel so helpless. I should have known that was having so much pain because it's not like 12. Quiches was like 10:12 and I'm scrubbing all the blood out and let you see that progression sound like, this is really bad."
"so,"
"So then the last day to date, you were joking. She was going to get bit more, run down in the evening. And then the next day."
"So the next day I was asked to come in at 8 a.m. And again, I was like visiting hours, don't start till like 11 for me to come in at 8 a.m. To talk about the results meant."
"So, I self."
"And ask them like to see what's going on, and he does show me the skins and they're like, she's stage. Rob Lee had it for a long time. And you know, you're asking me questions like why she has ever gone to talk to you later."
"Yeah, I know. He's like, how did it get so bad? They went."
"The one being mean, all the accusatory by was just like they want us to fight things. She is paying for her. So you see that her left breast still leak on and she had on her, right?"
"But India's has spread to her lungs and a bones. So they were like, we need to bring up a chemo. Now, they need it to arrange to like somewhere else cuz they didn't have the equipment to do it. Like are you okay with it? Can you consent? I'm like, yeah, just do whatever you can then I say that she know she has to call you. Let you know. I'm like don't tell her cuz"
"I know she was very skip but I knew that we had at the station going to give up and stir it. So I just said that she knows and I'm like, okay, fine. Then after all of that was done."
"we went over, I went to the bedside and she looks at me and"
And yet this would have been our last moment together.
"and she was kind of a sleeping and when they set down in Lehigh, Mommy and then she opens her eyes, so she's like"
Am I going to die?
"And I looked at him like, no."
"Is that the thing the names of like people and you blame you who survived the wave, closes her eyes, and she's hallucinating already. So I caught myself and I'm like, dang, you better come down cuz my siblings are all that work. So then we were just guys, this is that come down. My sister comes in and at the point of time, I took a little break and my best friend cuz she came down. And because the Moment I Saw Halloween,"
When I went back up.
"The last thing my mom ever said to me was, I took you so long when you go print out loud lyrics it's just a joke. I was like to relax so I can you can you rush over soon. So the doctor said great."
"But maybe not the best fish because basically the doctor was telling my sister was all alone and petrified, just like your mom is crashing. She might die. We're going to bring it to ICU now and then I'm getting my sister and and we're hugging. And we're like right now nice out and we just watch her being wheeled away until I see you in just like pushing I was like, why does those movies or shows in? And I'm just all I can think of is like so yeah, so that was"
And that was the day that so she went straight to I see you.
"Probably around 2 to 2 p.m. And at that time, I seen you, I have to stop selling their relatives that Mommy is in ICU, but yes, it when she crashed. Then we got the relatives in that's when the doctors got the siblings for a conference. I remember, we were at. I see you. And then they just had his room, and the three of us spent together. And we looked at each other and we're like, we know, and this is really it right now. I'll let you see. The doctor comes in and tells us."
We think she has.
"We think she has maybe a few days and then they said, that it got complicated because her lungs, does it to have walked in."
"And they really couldn't do much because chip to main team has, and they were so afraid that they did, this will complicate that I'm not in my brain is just like how you do not understand any of this, but it's just going to go, right? And then,"
"And then that's when they had an aunt who came in. And she, she was crying. And she's like, oh, by the way, tomorrow is your grandma's stuff, anniversary. 10, 10 minutes. She said that we looked my siblings. Like I said, they were like, oh crap. I spend as much time as you can and we look at each other. Like, we think Mommy's going to go tomorrow."
Do you really love me?
"We went into the room. She was really hooked up on the ventilator. This equation was Rihanna, and she was just a blanket and so many, so many tubes. We just"
"yeah, I couldn't sleep that night."
"I was thinking of the dumbest, I was thinking like, oh wait, we have an obituary. You don't have a recent picture of mom and I, so yeah, it's like looking at old pictures of her at night. And when I finally did sleep, I woke up at like"
"Five or six, or I don't know, but then Sunday at like 8."
You got to call.
"I didn't know, I knew I was just like yeah, we're on the way now and then I was like, it is raining and I woke everyone up and we all just got in the cab and just went straight to the hospital. I mean, thank goodness. The hospital is like literally, 15 minutes away. And then we all ran out then, and they just said that vitals were crashing. And they think it's just a few more hours and they say we think she's trying to hold on. But I think it's time for you guys to to say our goodbyes. My brother was taken out going and so is she, she was like driving going nuts too to jurong. And then when he was there and we were all dead."
"Girl decided we just surrounding and we're just looking at her right? Cuz some me. What do you do? And you can't do anything. I just look at her in there, was that"
"I,"
There was this weird feeling to just go and kiss her.
Is there any talk to her?
And I got that much Lancaster and I stayed the night yesterday. I was better.
"It's okay. We'll take care of it. So you don't have to, you have to hang on."
"We're going to be all right, she should rest. Don't worry."
In an accident.
"Nothing. I was my bread dough, and then my sister tends to just"
"Kiss Aaron and I wish them whatever it was. I don't know what to say. But after that, we could feel that she was still holding on cuz she was supposed to get for us."
And this is the part that I always remember because I had that second much to just go and kiss her again. So I kissed her and I was spending her you and Isaac five more minutes.
"I said, I said that Dennis Hernandez just holds me and she was supposed to me and she said your mom is gone."
"and I just collapse, I just called cuz everyone else in the room was wet and I turned around and I think I just"
I like this wheel or just like mommy's garden. It was very out of Body Experience.
"And two minutes of the debt, my uncle comes to my fault, his presence, and I just like mommy's garden."
"Everyone else to cover my uncle, cuz she has to go to call about the blind then and don't do anything. I mean, what do you mean? Mommy did it? And I'm still late not all of us to go and change into funeral clothes then just go straight to the cemetery. And so yeah."
We will washing her up.
"All right there, right before I leave. Why should I wrap my ankle?"
"And then he's like my partner is over all to you and it felt very when they finally Berto because it's women out the washing her up, but his men to do the heavy lifting so they carry her and they all bring it down. So it was my registered. So he lifted her into the plot of later on his side be sure she she face."
And then that's when the soil gets me and my family. I want to talk a bit about I guess that your feelings after after the funeral. How do you come to terms on a time to sit with and reflect on everything? Right? Because
"I wish you and the child XC60 something that was that you didn't even know about ya and then a couple of days. So I guess like, changing face, right to what?"
What was it like for you? Have you come to terms with her emotions in?
"And well, you know, that's like I said, it was the first death in the family like that. We, we can remember that we can process, right? And yeah, I've never had anyone close to me that song. So there was no real book."
"The hottest day was the next day. Is it wasn't because you go to sleep eventually. And then when you wake up and you're like a dream and then I just remember opening my eyes and it was like 8 a.m. And end. At first. I was still laying that hazy. Like, okay, what happened then, like mommy's gone come in and I just watch the clock go, and it's like 9:05. And I was just like, what would my me? Do the cats like driving? No more."
"Play remember, I ain't say go to the house and you don't censor all dead. Then I'm watching the plans. And then my neighbor comes out. We've been neighbors since I got out since I was one. So has been told her that my mom passed and she looks at me and watching the plants, and she makes a joke. Please say some. So solid that which means life is difficult without a mother."
"I look at him and I just smiled and said, she starts crying and then and then she pushes me away. How did you not know she left with you? How did you not know? And I start crying and I see she was hiding and she was hiding it. So."
"Dealing with grief is bad enough, but because of the circumstances we had to keep answering the same question. How did you not know? And it didn't just come. I understand why my neighbors did that because she herself is the survival skill, so probably projecting, you know, this with one relationship."
"I was at going on my, how did I not know? How did I not catch on? As I so involved, in wreck by my own life, you know, I was staying with my boyfriend, I'm laying was that he was, I so selfish, and I have to go for grief, but I think that's like me."
I need to take over her role. Now. I'm the woman of the house now.
"Africa. Like I don't even know how to cook anything and then looks at the mundane things right now. So like just keep the house running to make it seem like she was on holiday. I didn't I didn't think about it, then coming back and I didn't realize that I was, I was thinking that way. I'm just keeping the house nice and clean and then I don't know when it hit me that she's not here when she pops up in my dreams sometimes and then"
"And if I know she's happy, I know she said rest like family-wise they called in check in, but now it's back to normal. Yeah, and we kind of took over because"
"then the whole world went crazy, right? So,"
It did allow us to pause and it did allow me to process my grief.
"I was and then I became grateful for the weirdest things. I became grateful that she passed before this happened because no one could have seen in the hospital. We would have had the funeral rites are or maybe know if she's a phone or whatever. She was sick in the house, and we didn't know that she was sick and she'll be more."
Prone to getting covid or whatever. Like and and so grateful for your mom.
I don't do sex time to get back on the bus.
inability to
"Yeah, just come to come to you is like."
Situation or condition.
"I mean, I'm obviously talking as though, I'm putting myself in his shoes yet. And then from what I understood of her and there were few things when was"
She was always.
"play small, she didn't want to but then I guess she felt like"
"She didn't really want to, I don't want to but she just didn't feel she was Woody. Right? Like I said, was bringing that the, the women, the women and quiet in there. They listen to the guys should have said that we was because she didn't want us to to worry and get us something to really piss me off to Erica's light."
"Like she had been buying all the water and we didn't realize it, but she was using it to treat us Elvis's going to that girl. I was cleaning up his death. She, she would leave a lot of like notes around. House will be like recipes, grocery grocery list. Really cute and racing, and I was trying to find pieces of deleterious."
"So she knew she had it and as I read the Prius, that's it getting more and more. Intensely. Like I recognize them as just out of praise, you say, when you know, something is really bad. So she kept it to himself. I think because she was so fearful to be fearful and the sex, but it was still have area that she is asleep. And she felt that"
It was just a Leo and a pot to control mean.
"I mean, obviously I'm not I'm not as strict with them. So that was part of hood that felt like she felt as a good muslimah. Do I know it's a shame that. I mean Express King says so and as a woman, you know, it's yeah, well, you know,"
"He was divorced and pickets are leaving the nest. What else? Does she have? And that's a woman. Like I feel like, you know, we should probably internalize it as though she had some she felt something that we would have discussions about. Like she would feel like she didn't do enough to to, to stay married. Oh, yeah. That was tricky for her, you know, and Anna's kids already. She already felt like he wasn't able to, to guide us on the demo. And then I think she probably felt like"
Who is she?
We can see what we want to see and not feel beholden to.
"Someone's else's judgment and I feel like that wasn't a case of my mom and I felt like that was holding her back on Ashley and like Mommy, right? You know what you call it by a name and likewise. I just felt like,"
Parole was always item mommy or like the wife and she wasn't given room to explore something else.
"But because I personally was not touched by it, to me as a psychology is just right. You have the pink ribbon ribbon, buy all the stuff to buy in as a nice and ironically the week because my mom has I was at night and when it happens to you like this is real anyone."
"Why am I not been checked out yet? And then I know when you start to try to find a literature on it. That's a lot of good resources. That is so she can only read a mammogram and you're like salty and above. And I mean, even though I'm still researching because so we decided that my mom, my sister, and I are going to go get checked out and and make it like a ritual, right? To just deal with the grief and stuff and"
"so, I just think that"
It's really easy to just dismiss.
"Stories like this. As happened to me. I was guilty of that Beckham families Beckham friends, right? And it's yeah."
"Even if that's a you off your phone. I would say it was to just being the dog and to deal with it yourself. And then does it take to feel like it's a burden to share that. That's what family's for, that's what friends are for. Real. You are worthy of being loved, and taken care of. And I think as women we all like to fall into, like a, we take care of everyone else."
"I know it comes out there my just like my border, even if you can go for mammogram. Just do you know yourself examinations. You're there, a video that day. You can Google that. I'm just still safe to watch."
"But I was supposed to say that you're done cuz I have the tendency to have to be and just so yeah, you might hear about friends or family who have it. That's awesome. Let it make you paranoid as well. Yeah, it is really better to just live with the ease of mind. I found my check. I know my family's history and then I told you don't care because it's just so many survivors, right? So make the Bible and there is two, I mean my mom passed."
"Still so much good that came out of, it still teaching me things, even beyond the grave. You're still kicking my ass and it's only you is like all these lessons you learned. So. So yeah, it's"
"In this past year, I was seeing if that's changed a lot of things that I need to take care of myself."
"So in light of that, just don't be fearful. You just take care of yourself. This is totally normal. Just go do it."
Thanks for turning into this week.
"You guys want to check out her website, but she says about relationships. It's all, but if you like to ask you guys."
"Tune in to the full episode on Spotify, iTunes, Google podcast or wherever you listen to your favorite podcast."
"Welcome back to something private a podcast for Southeast Asian, women by Southeast, Asian Urban exploring conversations, around Health, the South community and love. My name is Nicole, and I am your producer and host."
"Last episode Jim and I share our experiences. Casing cutter forms of harassment in school and in the face didn't really surprised. As I think it's the safest across asia-pacific. All the individuals were fighting against harassment in our neighboring countries that you cuz he's ranked as the number one, most dangerous Mission for Women across assassinations, and number two in the asia-pacific."
"According to the study women have access to health care. Next laws, surrounding human, safety and religious critics. Say that the movement."
"This has led to the delay in the passing of a much-needed sexual assault. If you write something that many of us, me Siesta, basic human, right in the country of high-profile struggle and assistant and Survivor from the organization. All about you, Thank you for having me years old and I'm a writer and activist. I currently am the one of the core directors of all about your partner, which is a movement of anti-public street by the ones I understand a bit about Indonesia is in terms of gender equality. So, just a background, a quick background, that Indonesia is the fourth, most populous country in the world, right? With the largest Muslim population in the world. We do have a certain basis of a"
"Religious upbringing and religious background, which is very rooted in our, in our daily life. And we have such a deep-rooted cultural history, which has also been implemented, you know, when are going to be like. So, our gender equality is Ian different areas, you know, for larger cities like the capital for us here in Jakarta. We are, you know, the women are facing a different challenges with the rural areas or the, you know, Eastern Eastern part of the car that we are, we are more so of us fighting for equality in the workspace, you know, gender pay Gap opportunities more"
"Snelling professionals. But we still have those areas were still fighting for poverty, or even, you know, allowing women to work outside of their houses, where whatever they want. So we have these different authors that were at work. So I think the rate of, or the status of the general quality is very much a variety on wherever wherever you find these women in danger because we are such a nation but that the context of religious religion itself, you know, it has been translating or prescribing these religious beliefs that come from of male perspective, that comes from a standpoint, you know, which is why it is so hard to fight against those those contacts those way of thinking, because we have these prominent leader."
"That doesn't want anything to Indy. Endanger their, their belief and thinking men will always be the leader of men will always be on top, you know, women with should especially wives, you know, we should simply bow down to their husbands or get do anything with with permission, you know, and we're still allowing, you know, polygamy. So multiple wives and wives have no say in them. So we still have that very domesticated believe that women should stay in their place because men can create and make decisions for them. But that is so far away that from the, you know, original meaning of of Islam itself, you know, from from what a larger scale, if it's Islam is very much, a gender equality face. A gender equality believe in an hour."
"Things. We don't have a sayings that men should be, you know, leaving the women behind it. It's always balanced. It's coming from a place of fear that they don't want to jeopardize. Their place in society, is one of the countries in the world. The most that considered the most unsafe for women that have been some high-profile case. That's where I do the victims. And then the only didn't get the redress that they start, but they were also then had like a jail term for speaking out against a perpetrator."
"41 year old school administrator was handed a six-month prison sentence after recording, harasses, sexually suggestive, phone calls anymore. Question is, I think it's, it's still just a conversation about human rights in general, when we, when we talk about victims of sexual assault and the freedom to do, you know, freedom of expression. And because on a lot of these high-profile cases, the case was not that they were victims and speaking out, but because they were they, you know, they're the incident was caught on tape, work on camera and then they just shared it, you know, who shared it to social media, or the public just bringing light on their case, which backfired because we have this law, that if we share, you know, pornographic materials, or, you know,"
"Sexual material, you can get fine or you can get like you said jail term. So I think there was still a line that they did not recognize yet. It's not that they were sharing pornography material, but they were sharing incidence of themselves. Do you know, they were sharing proof which is also a double-edged sword because when a victim's report their case to the police, the first thing the police, do you have proof and evidence but it shouldn't share it on social media, but that's how desperate they were trying to get their message across trying to get their story across. So I think it's just a whole lot of nonsense and and still on logical practices of of bees, loss of being being put into place, you know, because okay, it's good that we have these lost sharing, you know,"
"Material. When it comes to sex tapes, for example, when it comes to revenge for cases, that's great. You know, we have that lot in place for that. But when it comes to sharing evidence or should improve, you should take it with a different, you know, with a, with a different light. So I think we have these incredible loss that are written down, you know, on paper. But when it, when it comes to being implemented, it's not really worth it either. Which is why we have that sexual violence bill. They were trying to push know. We're trying to protect victims that have evidence. That. That doesn't interesting because in this vein, I guess when you guys are still in the interim of trying to push for the sexual violence, bill in the meantime Howard victims and survivors speak out against"
"What tree does mostly is that? We have these services and you know that are coming from communities and organizations, you know collaborators from hollaback that are very much being a safe space for victims. We have 11 organization. That is focusing only on rape victims and you know that they secure their anonymity from these victims that have these weekly or monthly meetings that victims can share with each other and get the help they need without ever, you know, I'm covering their identity and facing their produced but also we have, you know, just"
"Lawyers that are willing to help, you know, pro bono, we have you no law students that are all, all all about making. These. This movement forward to pushing this movement forward, without any hint of burdening. The victims on on anything, you know, but I think the most secure thing right now for you to do is not share your identity, not share your story and public forum. You know, if you if you want to deal with your story first, if you want to start your healing process, I think my my biggest advice is to get in touch with these communities and chocolate inside first, you know, without trying to get Justice right away. I think maybe that legislation is important in terms of the Ring gender equality, because I think people and understanding as to where I am."
"60 people about the sexual violence. Bill back from lawmakers in Indonesia against the sexual violence with me. What the bill is about 1st and why is it happening stands for proposed Bill to combat sexual violence, right? So it's, it was made us to make our legal system. More victim oriented in dealing with cases of sexual violence and it identify the major nine forms of sexual violence, which includes sexual harassment, sexual exploitation Force contraception or abortion rate forced marriage, where is prostitution sexual slavery and sexual torture. So our current criminal code only recognizes two of those sexual violence, which is rape and you know, this ambiguous harassment term, you know, which they don't really until what what harassment is, what harassment is."
"The bill itself is very, you know, it's it's very detailed and it's quite a long document but all-in-all what we want is please have these lived, legalized call Sis off protecting victims. So it's not actually, you know, we're not crashing some, you know, Western eyes or margarine. Agenda of Ideal timing is Amina. We just want to protect victims and victims, Cannondale, men, and women, you know, or a minority other minority groups, I think because they're talkin about victims of sexual violence or sexual assault, it automatically for them, you know, rape free sexual activities, you know, it's still such a taboo subject here. You don't even sex education sex in general, you know, sexuality is not explored a lot for a majority of people are not publicly at least."
"I think simply of the term sex or even speaking about sex in general is still for them and icky subject which is why they put it on, hold for such a long time because they think it's all we can talk about sex wearing such a religious Nation, or we can talk about sexuality or exploring sexuality or, you know, Force sexual violence. Because we are such a, you know, you're respected, religious background. Also, you know, because this this bill also entails these, you know, how are my minority groups? We don't, they don't still don't recognize that as part of the society, you know, what? Are lgbtq are very much discriminated so they don't want to. It's I think it's just a way for them to not acknowledge a certain certain groups, not acknowledge our issues or problems, which for me, making a change or off of any."
"And you know, first you must admit that that you're wrong, you know, and I think that's not, that's the thing that we're not doing it as a as a whole nation. What is the Public's General?"
I'm aligned with you and in others comedy.
Agreed that you should not like cars or like that. What was supposed to public Society? General perception on the move.
"I think I'm for the for the large amount of population is date. They don't seem to have a standpoint because they don't have enough education on it. You know, they don't really if this issue is not on mainstream television is not being put forth in in layman's. Terms is not being discussed in, on it on the dinner table or just around, you know, on the streets with with people. They're not talking about women's issues. They're not talking about sexual violence. It's not something that they talked about ever, or just simply sex and sexuality in general. So, I think the ones that are our allies, the ones that are fighting with us, are the ones that have that sort of privileged, you know, and then that privilege from Wells. But also can come from education and Trump can come from households that are open in talking about"
"Quality Inn talking about, you know, relationships because I think that's what I also saw for my personal experience, you know, coming from such a small tight-knit family as an only child, we have both of my parents are very much. You do cultured worldly. They've been around the. They've been around the block, so with me. They don't they don't censor anything. But what what I can talk at home, I can't talk with my peers. I can't talk with my teachers and that's what I found, you know, law there still some some subjects that women are aren't allowed to talk, you know, because where we should be good example, you know, the morality of the society are very much based on pressure upon us. So I think we still have hope that that type of the spirit acts as well. So I think the way you can truly see the differences, you know people who are fighting with us and not."
"And with the knot is the larger amount of a percentage from from that group. It's not because they are anti women anti-feminist, don't know, they don't have they're not equipped yet, you know, with the tools and and you know, what, what we are speaking out about because our issues when when it's in the news or when it's being you know documented or presented to them. It's such a in a nasty way in the very fear based in a very, you know, I'm talking about us like we're some random groups that were not Indonesian, that would not hold them Traditional Values. So they they've, they've just been president that our issues in a wrong or different way. It must be incredibly."
"If anybody in my human rights has such a bill so it is kind of giving me why they would be much resistance or like a lack of support. I why isn't it that, why is it taking so long for you? Don't people like us who, who for us? This is just common sense. You know, why doesn't victims get legal protection? That's it. That's all we're fighting for. You. Don't forget to get legal protection. Why doesn't that? Why is? Why is that so difficult? But I think is coming from that. Stack the point of their narrow Minds as in"
"Where where a religious station? No one have no one have sex before marriage. That really a hard-headed denial for them to sex doesn't happen, you know, so why are these people saying that they're sexually sexually harassed, sexually assaulted, you know, they just are turning the other way. Not seeing the reality of it or even not acknowledging. The reality of it that just because we don't talk about sex in school or at home, not it doesn't mean that it's not going to happen course, people are going to have sex, you know, and the dangerous part is that they keep that Narrative of what we're just not going to talk about it, so you won't happen. But now, received the invitations of it, in the younger, people are having it and and learning it through. Pornography learning it from their friends were all. So uneducated. I know where, you know and and"
"Bring in the unhealthy way and we seen out marriages, you know, child pregnancies happen everywhere every day. Not only in large cities, like the kind of, but you know, what are they going to do in rual rual areas? So, I think they still have this way of thinking that we're just not going to talk about it. So it won't. And also you do for the poor are lgbtq. We're not going to talk about. Sexuality is only men and women, you know, we're not going to talk about other genders. Are there sexuality that doesn't there, just, you know, throwing their hands up in the air? So they don't, they don't know that. People are still going to explore themselves individually, you know, people are going to still explore their sexual explore their identity regardless of what they say, you know, so I think they still just don't"
"Acknowledge that a Muslim Nation are having this, exploration are having this other worldly ways of living or thinking, you know, we're taking a short break."

"Now, back to that store."
"I want to watch a video about I guess. Holla back to Jakarta in general because I specifically you guys focus on Twitter. Batman. Can you set the sticks around in Indonesia? And why did is a focus for you? Like heading in the whole way that you guys phase? Why did you choose to adopt this particular on that actually is a global movement from a while ago, even before 2017. And they have been, you know, raising Awareness on catcalling on basement because the majority of the world still don't think that calling is. So when the sex at this picture from the states, came here and started living here. She started this movement and start Gathering volunteers and"
"From all around Jakarta and started, so we implemented the teachings of the bystander intervention, for example, and the, you know, the messages into a local. And we saw a huge number of people who were, you know, who got our bags School supported are our mission and issues because it happens to them on a regular basis and just a few specific. You've already mentioned that your card. There was one of the most dangerous cities for women to live in 54% chance to be transmitted by happens to women."
"Yet one out of ten, men have also experienced wrestling, and also, this regards to our lgbtq Piers, 36% are, you know, verbal harassment, 52% are children. So, we also have a bag has this apart for him, on our website for people to show their stories. And we have such as surge amount of stories that are coming from elementary school kids, you know, middle school. Kids wear your school uniform going to school getting a harassed. So this is where becomes such a, you know, trigger for us to really want to push our awareness for which 53% of this case has happened on public transportation and 35% of these cases happens in in broad daylight. So, I think this can also the skin"
"Blank are the myths of harassment only happening at night, you know, women are wearing. You know, how many outfits revealing clothes walking alone at night, you know, where debunking all those Miss? Because it happens to everyone. We have people in burqas and he jobs that are her kids, you know, students to grown women anywhere, you know, not, not only walking alone. I think the only antidote is, if we are walking with men with with, you know, we sometimes you have to pretend that these men are there are boyfriends, you know, even if they are our mail just are simply our friend. So it happens on the on a regular on a on a daily basis."
"You know, women coming for work women and men coming for were talking about how, you know, they were walking on the street and then I can. But he just drunk people just want to tell their stories. But lately you have been more of these environments that they're coming out about maybe just because they don't have any other platform to to tell their story but you know someone who are in high school, so"
Your she said oh she said when I was in high school second or third grade.
"I was coming home from school, using a public transportation, a bus public bus and presently, I sat at the back of the bus and besides me was an elderly gentleman and elderly, this means Grandma and Grandpa like figure, right? And"
"Maybe she thought that I didn't notice, maybe he thought that I didn't feel but I know that she was groping my behind my butt. Oh, by the way, I was wearing my school uniform which is the, which is a long skirt and shirt which is not tied, a very much lose. So there are no body parts showing. They're not you know, it's not tight. So now I have this, whenever I"
"Get on board on a public transportation. So I just walk home from me. Personally, what? I see these happenings do to children, if it's a sore subject. How can they how can, how can this happen? How can they sexualizing rejected by these young kids?"
"You know going into the hospital right after Bruce, you know, so bye. Bye. A sexual violence against babies, which is unspeakable for me on on how they can see someone little as that and come to a conclusion of your being sexual being. So I think that's that's the most those those stories that come from the way they tell it, the way they speak. In all the way. They righted, you. Don't forget this coming from such a late lunch, but they're, they're so confused on. Why is this happening to them? Why is this, are these dogs doing this to them? Because we've had, it has become such a generational, trust issues, even with adults of like teachers, or, you know,"
"Religious leaders, or even, like, at least, you know, we have been discussed with them because of these gangsters, you know, because of these adults doing these two younger kids. So I think it's much more than sexual violence. Is it really, you know, becomes a generational issue. And I think it also takes a generation to kill and I think that's by not admitting and by the government not supporting us, not backing us, up are dismissing. These kids stories invoices as well. Hang out in the voice, for these people who don't have a pet from to go to the shared. That was terrified. So, tell me a bit about"
"Job at golf course. I how may be your own brush with lights sexual violence. And like how they communicated to where you are now being a writer, and activist and putting it off for a little bit about myself. I grew up abroad. Most most, most of the time with an only child with, you know, Berry"
"open minded and very, very stamolis parents. You can say, you know, so I can see the difference in, you know, me and between me and my friends, how review sings how our point of view was. So when I had my first incident of sexual assault and harassment it I was fourteen and I just got back here and I was still trying to accustom to year of the local Indonesian teen life. How how we were hanging out how we spoke with each other, how dating was from my point of view, was simply a teen dating, you know, are just some someone that I adored, I admired his football skills. I, of course, thought he was cute stuff in my and I just saw this cute guy and I liked it, you know, that was it, but since he was more experience,"
"You know, being in a relationship or being sexual in general, he nudged me towards very sexual innuendos and activities that I wasn't comfortable with it. For example, introducing me to warn, you know, which led me to always believe that corn was the only sex education that I could have, you know, even though back in elementary school, when I was abroad, I got sex education, but it was an explicit and no one was able to talk to me that way. He'll explain things the way that corn was visually portraying. He always try to take ownership of my buddy in front of people and grabbing me touching me everywhere or even buy like extorting money from me. Simply doing a late."
"On sexual activities that made me really uncomfortable because I didn't know any better, you know, because I didn't know what, dating should shouldn't tell what, you know, what should what is a healthy relationship? How to communicate if you're not wanting to do something, how to say no, you know, I think still the mindset of sexual violence in general, especially here in Indonesia. That the property manager is something that has someone that you don't know a stranger, you know, in a back alley way in the middle of the night, and you're alone with someone, you don't know, and just do whatever they want to you. They don't, it's not really talked about that. It is going to be your friend, can be your family member to be stopped, and it could happen at school or at home, you know, someone very close to you, and we seen the statistics on that. So I think really just because of that."
"Imbalance of a knowledge experience and dynamic in general. I think that made it very tough for me to take control of my general. So when I finally got to leave for college in the States, you know, I was growing back into my skin for say, you know, I was becoming, you know, of a woman. I was becoming an adult. So I did to my journey of Womanhood China excelled there, you know, and I had an incident when I was a freshman of sexual assault and violence with a senior, and I was a freshman at that time and I never never go anywhere without anyone else, you know, without I'm never out alone. So, of course, at that night, I had my girlfriend's one of the girls, contacted a group of senior boys."
"Cool. We're also going to the same party with us and said, why not joinable for groups together, you know and thinking that they can protect us in any way but you do without my knowledge one of the voice of one of the senior boys was someone that I knew prior, you know, just passing by and classes and there were rumors around or just you know, how she is around that. This guy like me, but at that time, I didn't, I wasn't interested in him. I was interested in someone else. You don't, even though he didn't make it to the party, but everyone was on board and on the same page on saying that, I wasn't looking for anything with him. So, throughout that party, I can see now, as an as an advocate, I can see how grooming started, you know, how he was isolating me alone. Separated me with my friends, you know of cornering? Me, you know, saying,"
"Sweet sweet stuff just to lure me in and we were still in the in the whole Party public Vibe. And then he took me upstairs to it was a frat house and he took me upstairs that into a bathroom. He tried to go into the bathroom and bedroom at one point. But what I liked was with any I admired was the boys from the Frat from the fraternity saw that and saw my discomfort you do, because he was drunk and I wasn't. So the boys from the fraternity saw and and stop that. You don't know, you can, you're not going anywhere. They locked all the bathroom, the lot, all the bedroom, but what they didn't anticipate was, he could take me outside. So that's what he did. He took me outside. He took my phone away and pocketed his phone, so I couldn't contact anyone. It was dark in the middle of the night. No one was around outside."
"So he tried to push himself up on me and he was shouting this, these things, you know, just how a drunk would be. How we know. How come you don't love me? How come you don't want to be with me? I'm just saying these things, and we got into an altercation, a physical altercation, where a lot of the houses in front of the, you know, around the the frat house, have the sensor of a motion sensor. So whenever you see someone moving the, the lights to turn on and I could see that the people inside the house saw, what was happening, you know, we were fighting. We were, I was punching him saying no streaming, but they didn't do anything. And he took me into a parking lot later on, and simply just this role and push myself to do sexual things to him. And I still said, no, I still said no. And that's when the bus from the University pulled in, and I screamed at the top of my lungs and events."
"All the people realize what was happening, and that was be the first and last incident with him, but I didn't see him again after that. And that night, I was surrounded with my friends, you know, they all stayed with me at back in the dorm and the next day. We just reported my incident and last thing we heard was that he got expelled, your info holla back. I guess the future of life in in in the rest of the country. So we are celebrating a company day and a little background on who Cassini was Captain is was a prominent Indonesian national hero from job. She was a Pioneer in the area of education for girls and women's rights for Indonesian in general. Not only women. So she was simply a woman who said,"
"No in being domesticated at her time, you know, she wanted to learn to speak education, formally and informally so happy. Today is a symbol for women empowerment in Indonesia. And every April 21st, us all of commemorate, her memory and her Legacy. It's a day to celebrate her but also it's a day too."
"Explore the issues of a of women in Indonesia, but also to converse about what what's not being done from her time of fighting for her rights until now, you know, so we see a lot of events that are talking about women empowerment that are talking about women's issues in every facet of life. But also since it is Indonesia, celebrations, like this tend to be watered down as in the government or the public in general, would simply want to commemorate her by having children dressed up as her, you know, with traditional clothes, having cooking competitions have been poetry competition and really actually setting the tone back to what company was fighting a gems, you know, which is what is margarine."
"Activist are trying to turn that narrative and change that perception of the day itself. You know, we shouldn't have cooking a competition just to commemorate her. So she wasn't, she was actually trying to get out of the kitchen, you know, so why are we, why are we trying to push it back? So, I think of, and it's also still, it's still very much big on on girl celebrating her and not boys, you know, and I think the most important conversation is to talk to me, little boys, or young, man, you know, or men in general about her about what she meant to their lies, what she went to their families, and their history. We're not fighting for only women were fighting for all of us, you know, human beings people in general when we don't want feminism, that is only catering to women. We also want to take care of the men and the Allies that we have having more women in in spaces in every"
"I said, in every aspect because every decision made is its, you know, catering to both women and men. So I think more of having more women speaking out on, on their achievement on their opinions on their accomplishments. Also, of course, we want to pass this bill that is very much troll victims. And we want we want all of the people to know what sexual harassment is what sexual violence is. And what our boundaries what is consent in that can be taught in schools or at homes and simply not having this giant elephant in the room and not talking about it. So he acknowledging our pain and admitting defeat to it, you know admitting defeat to to patriarchy in general and start changing the whole system. Thank you so much for that. Feminism."
"The whole of Indonesia. Thank you so much for having me. Thanks saying, hope you enjoyed this week's episode place to travel to New Quality is ongoing and it is our duty to think about people in our community, but"

"Hi everyone. So before we start this episode, just a small disclaimer. And this episode, we talked about pets, Mia and HPV Jets and I might have missed again them for the same thing. Hehehe before the age of 26. I was referring to the HPV vaccination under the national childhood immunization schedule NCIS. Sorry, sorry reduce your risk of getting cervical cancer. And if you're between 25 and 29 1/2 had sex a Pap test or a pap. Smear is encouraged to look for abnormal changes in the cervical cells, and this dude can be done at a subsidized rionda, Singapore, screen for Life National cervical cancer, screening program, and it is not as cute introduction, Hazel high of a 0."
"Okay, you could barely hear it was ridiculous. If you haven't listened to our International women's day for bulshit really from the bottom of your heart. I need mine was okay, but this is the first time ever she is coming out. There ain't no telling the story, probably the people. How do you have to worry about and I don't think everyone around me knows about to either. So I'll try and she'll actually if I was going to share it and even up to like just before and that the studio was still thinking like, you know, should I, because we don't discuss the forehead and I think that's why they were very surprised as well. And he's just seen the look on that produces face my fears realized. When that guy behind this incredible, if you don't know what we're talking about, go listen to the podcast. It's really worth listening to when I'm sure, it made an impact on a lot of people going through and I don't think you're overreacting."
Are we overreacting?
"What to do with extra free to talk about something entirely different. It's Women's Health. And we're supposed to be going to talk about I guess at normal bleeding. During a. Of course, I mean 30. But in between sometimes you get spotting, you get bleeding for me. Just ask you guys had that ever happened to you? Where I live. Is irregular. Y'all flow is way too. Heavy a way to light. Are you bleeding between periods my ovaries? And I have a very strange relationship. What does that mean?"
"It's all right, I go by. Like really late. Like I think I only started bleeding properly, like maybe sixteen or are you mentioned it? And I don't think I've mentioned this before I usually try and like brush it off cuz I don't know what the hell happened. Do you think you've let think I bled but I think it only happened once the entire play 12 days going to see and then it happened again. Once again."
"Because that was only when it started like coming probably, right, but even then it was very irregularly. So maybe I would get it maybe like 3 to 5 times a year, but it would come this month. Mine is it would disappear for like 3-4 months and then he'll come again? Because my mother is mentioned me that when she was younger, write a regular genetics. Why you never consulted?"
"The small mid-twenties or something. And then it started coming. Very regularly. Piece of Happy Meals on Hotspot, cost in the oven. But recently, it's been, I want to see you regularly because it's still comes monthly, but it's just been, I think the cycle has sort of stretched, huh? Yeah, let's see, right in the SLI. It was supposed to come like, 1112, kind of okay, sure. And then eventually it came. Maybe like 16. 17. Banana next. Man. You think you'll come like 60 70? As well know that stretches later. Okay, the cycle has extended so many many more."
"Okay. Okay, for me. I'm the first time ever. I got my. Like I said in the past season you blood in your friend so far."
I would never forget that. Okay?
"Okay. Anyways, yeah, I was bleeding for nine days straight and the floor was crazy, man. I remember the first time I ever got my. And I couldn't sleep. No, do all the night. I just kept waking up to change my change. My gosh. I really didn't have sleeping anymore. She was in 119 Indian. My heaven. My mom had to put a plastic bag beneath the mattress, the bed sheet. So that even if my blood flows out, right, you know, you wouldn't be called written."
"Tell me the first timer last year, during the circuit breaker. I don't know why what happened to be. I got a bit more rest and stuff like that last exercises moving around cuz you couldn't go out, right. My. Was later than usual. I do think that the amount of rest and the amount of exercise that we are getting effects. Most definitely, I will talk to you as well. I was just telling these ladies lingerie. My. Has been pretty regular but he does. I've been very lucky to me as I step into the studio. I was Bleeding Love. On the first day of Chinese, New Year is super flat. Using my iPhone Health app."
Which means it's 12 day of the Lunar New Year. One week ago. I'm bleeding. I actually have to go to wear a tampon.
"Why didn't I like with you? I hope to find out what's happening with me. Maybe it's spotting and what's happening this whole uterine bleeding spotting. It actually happens to a lot of females. Is there a difference in your life? And I feel like it's not talk about enough. For example. Now, I don't even know what's happening in myself, Why do you think right? We don't have this kind of like the educational. We don't have this information. That's true. We have schools. Have this, it's funny because we may think that our mother's maid Kitchens mobile such things, right? But I think of it, I don't even know. Your mom knows what's going on, you know what I mean? Because I definitely might, my grandmother wouldn't be talking to her about this."
"Some information if they may not be accurate. That's true. Yeah, I think with most people produce you will like me enough to your girlfriends when your having a. But not when you're experiencing abnormal bleeding, but I just announced it."
"Maybe for other people love, everything. Record my boyfriend. You have no idea what to do with it. Yeah, I got you. Okay, and I go see doctor if, you know, my girlfriend's about such things. So my best friend is Google is Google. Find out what the heck is going on."
"Google home alarm for CSE really does the mysteries of normal bleeding, but we are not a doctor situation. Has severe. Go see a real doctor. Can you Google it? Just tell you at the end of the day? Yeah, you did not hear that. She used to expand spotting quite often, especially when she's stressed or she's working a lot without sleep. So at the beginning, she was going to look it up online. Go Google it. Cuz I always either she's pregnant. So she has cancer."
"Beretta cat. It's really just literally a spot. So, spotting is basically when it's it doesn't qualify as a flow is the definition of spotting much, lighter bleeding than normal. Menstrual bleeding. I like a normal. It is so like that. You don't require a pad or tampons and pantyliners suffices for sure cuz it's so light, right? And it maybe you rate a brown in color and occurs when you are not having your regular. Okay, interesting. Yeah, me neither. But have you guys ever had a. Fluoride? That was at normal means heavier than normal or lighter than his lease. It your first time in nine days in the room and I was dying from like the loss of blood during like the thickest pad."
"I'm not even sure. I was so worried. I think I was like, 13 or 14."
"Okay, but but you know what? Another fun fact. This is why I feel like, you know, goes we really need to be better equipped with such knowledge that when I was really young. I also asked my friends. How come Alyssa blood donation centers? That was calling out people to donate blood."
"That was how naive I was when it came to knowledge. Okay. On this kind of visual, but since I just had like a body Star Trek spelled. Yeah, and it cannot be used for Cross Blood Donation. Love. I think it's just blood that you can open to someone else cuz it contains uterine lining light up. Like the floor. That was basically nothing. I think my parents in general, a quite light and quite short, but they usually lost me be like the Papas."
"Alright, sweetie. You can just liners, I can just in case, right? 560, kind of flu. Is it normal to throw that you know, actually where your panty liner me justify?"
"I don't know if I should see one because it's like you regular, maybe you should go see a guy need to listen, to worry about it. Right? And I'm eating at this friend told me that, you know, you should go for a pap smear because before the age of 26 or something, you should get the Jets in. You ordered for my goodness about the pap. Smear process was quite interesting. So basically she made me lie down the bit. I was not prepared for this at all. She made me lie down on the bed, remove my shorts ripped my legs open and she stuck her finger in me like all the way."
"Why was it like we do for the night? I thought was necessary. Yeah, but she really had to go all the way into. I don't know what happened a year ago. So my memory is fuzzy, but I think she was so stuck on something else to sort of like, extract, whatever. But I would advise all ladies to go do it. I'll go get your pap. Smear test done and your HPV Japs Miami. So they took one year ago and I still haven't gotten my job. Just get it done soon. Okay, I think personally, for me, like I said, I have been having pretty regular. Say, except for one point in my life, when I decided to go in birth control."
"What he told me, the insane amount of side effects that come with birth control. So I didn't tell you I was seventeen, right? I didn't know that it would call cause I don't know. Like, sometimes like home Moana and balanced as you get used to it in the first few months, right? Then, my friend put me. Do you know, right? If you just continue eating your birth control you can skip your. Me and you don't take that one week break. I do not advise this. Let me just tell you first cuz I've been through this. Where is anyone? We off that when you have your. OK Google pills, which is nothing less evil. Okay, so if you skip the sugar pills or if you are on a three-week pack and you just continue taking it, my friend told me that you could schedule. So I tried I was like my kids. I want to continue taking my birth control. Okay. For about 3 or 4 months Street, I didn't get a"
"But I was like, I think my hormones were everywhere. There was something that was wrong with it mean, you know what, I call a bit like depressed, because of this year, because of birth control and I was not using it right now. We very regular for about a few months. They're supposed to actually, right. I've had people tell me that when my. Was irregular, I've had people seem like he was controlling. It helps with cramps is wiser than really debilitating crimes kind. But no, it's very variable Grecia doctor before you decided to go ahead. You choose for your friends."
"Well, I'm just going to eventually. I decided birth control is not for me because it was like. What's not to think of me? How do you know? What do you have to do? What I got to do? You know? Yeah, so is you got really heavy menstrual bleeding, can something that you might have, it's called PCOS polycystic ovary syndrome or an underactive thyroid gland. That hypothyroidism is a very common thing for. I think that you don't scare. So like what do I have this? But this these are some of the reasons why you could be experiencing heavy, you're bleeding. It could also be conditions like endometriosis and adenomiosis. Boston to Maine in the house is basically irregularities with your uterus and ovaries lie,"
"If you have an intrauterine device, the IUD, right, it could cause heavy bleeding as a side effect of a girl cancer miscarriage. Aldi's can cause a whole movie of different things. What is going on with this Fred Wright? Who told me quite recently as well. So, I think for us, it's not that with her like bleeding all the time. Okay, like what do you mean all the time? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like almost all days of the month because of that. Right? So she wouldn't get it checked out. Okay, then not sure the exact but basically I think ovary and her"
"Fallopian tubes, I think would like enlarged. Like they will maybe like double the size that they were supposed to be. Yeah."
"Okay, and she wouldn't have known if she didn't go get it checked out the scary. So it was either like she did surgery or they sent. Like, you can try going on like medication and they will see how it goes. So she decided to try like the Mets and Route 54 doing surgery. So she's still online medication, but now it's like she'll bleed. Whenever it's like, sporadic can come anytime if it's like spotting but it's a shot slow, but I just need time. So you have to be wearing a hat, all the time, all the freaking time, the first rifle at least find out what what kind of seafood can get better. Okay. So what about bleeding in between your cycle?"
"Like you are now, I'm really confused because like, I told you my. Was listening with about a vehicle as well. If you're tracking your. Right, use a reputable app. I'll look into that privacy kind of like statement because a lot of these apps actually don't protect the very well, and if you really really like today, what kind of flower am I having other people in the pool can see you later? Okay. They just created the new. Tracking of all the music. Can you? Please go check out the privacy and security. Calendar so that you"
"Set calendar privacy and intimacy is PC. Right? What it does is it gets you to the first day of it. All the way to the last day and you can tell you at this day and this date, what are your chances of getting pregnant? When he mention anything to help though, like a flow, but it is not spotting cuz I'm worried about right now, right? So maybe I had too much curry last night."
"Curry causes bleeding of the toilet. Just now involves stomach cramping when I put uses site, and she was missing for our last episodes recording because she was an empty and just go ask her if. So, what what what do you get? Do you get a flu and then I joked about it. And I said, is there a bun in the oven in the home? She replied and said or the bun left?"
"Yeah, I had that face, too."
She's at the house because of.
"Oh my God, this thing and then she was thinking, like, what's up, man? I thought you went to a doctor surprisingly. She already knew that she was pregnant because she peed on the stick. And then when she went to the doctor that she told her that, oh, yeah. This is like a, a miscarriage. What do you call a biochemical miscarriage, biochemical pregnancy? So, this happens very often to women. But if she didn't pee on the stick, right, she wouldn't have known that she was pregnant and that if I left, yeah, I would have thought it was a normal life. He's out there who didn't know they were pregnant. They would have think they would have thought that this is just another."
"Debbie, what's happening to you?"
But it did have like a whitish thing in it.
"Also, she said it's not office poor thing but it didn't heavier. So it looks exactly like a. There was no way she could have gotten the. Right and that's why she went to get it checked out. So she also mentioned that this happens really early on in the pregnancy, right? Developed it literally just ambule. So I'll call you once I calling her asking. How are you? I really appreciate it. Oh my goodness, really, really, really good amount of love in this Instagram account, if it will Empower you."
"So that we have a space to display. So really we hope that, you know, you take care of yourself taking a mental health and just know that whatever is meant to be, is meant to be. So your regular. Right. What are some of the causes? That was one of the examples that could be ovulation spotting? This is a light bleeding that occurs when you ovulate when your ovary release an egg, okay, every woman will experience this. In fact only about 5% of women, out of all, women will experience. Yeah. What happened?"
"When the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining, many women mistake this for implantation bleeding because it happened so early. They don't realize that they're pregnant, but control pills causes bleeding as well. Like what happened to you another time works for you as well and it is not such a life decision and I can't wait to let me know cause damage to the lining of the vagina and make you bleed a little bit. You're so right. So I have a friend many friends off of Bissell."
"Hello. You don't need them. OK, Google. It could be anyone. Tell us. I didn't hear this from her but I'm afraid she may be. He's the first evolved to be the messenger. Told me that she was like something in her was damaged. Like and it was quite Outlets. Very strange that we couldn't understand if I'm wrong. I could be wrong. If you like living with mentioned something quite high up. Okay, give you is like how you bright and then she was like from sex."
She literally rearrange her guts.
Understand. Right? I mean none of us with bad. So we don't know why she happen but we can't understand that. Yeah.
Read text.
Incredible. What happened damage Ishq wristlet?
What is a can write about it? And I don't think.
"It's a human but I think it might have been a foreign object. I think so, too."
"Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. Okay, probably be careful of what you say."
Down there.
How much do you love? Hold on censored hotspot prices? Thank you for that. To be honest. This is like what I hope that all goes can have a conversation that we had a few like we never went to get the disc to the kind of conversations that we have any way all the time. And now we give you an inside microphones and cameras and including all of you in a little conversation.
"That's not the point. I don't want to be careful with foreign object. Well Island that. If I am spotting in between my. It is not too big a cause for concern, and I don't have to worry so much that I lose sleep over it, because it happens to many women and, you know, it can be many causes as mentioned, in this episode of her. What kind of? Yes, but is, it gets too serious? You should definitely go and check out those, I've lend it, you really need to be well, informed about what's going on in your body to have buttons. Cuz I put myself in the shoes of what I go to my mother tell her that I'm bleeding normally now, but if you are slightly younger, perhaps, that is something that yeah, you need to do. If you can see a doctor independently by yourself, perhaps you need to be more open. Share it with in someone who you trust."
"I think this is maybe sort of like, made me think a little bit more and I think maybe if, you know, it gets like more irregular or like, whenever something strange happens that I should probably go see. Doctors thing is, I haven't actually seen one, you know, so I can just get it checked out and see what's going on. All three of us. Go and then we produce and play."
"Yes, please go get your pap smears, promise. We will also go and get ours as well as the 26th because the other time I think my friend mentioned something about subsidies, if you get your pet smear done before the age of 26 lighter than I think either of us some subsidies or something like that. So I was 26 last year, right? So I've crossed right? Yeah, but 2020 the Nexus. So, what day does cilantro recommended write 29 years old, but I believe my, my guy, me told me for the cervical chat, right? It's best to get it before you have sexual intercourse."
You don't need to call me. Please go and get the jet. Efficacy is much higher.

"One time I got, I hate this. I hate vagina the American League 2020. My vagina is itchy the outside if you are walking them because we get Monday for me to come home later to the day, you said,"
"I'm sure, I'm sure."
It's a main character problem. Like other people that are around you. They are not sight characters to a story. Not everyone is living that that that the same life.
"He was with Sonia. Thank you for joining us yet again, for another episode of Mannix playing. And today, my guest is too. Well. It's kind of going to be quite a mouthful because I recently left my job. So I would say that I am kind of like a full-time content creator. Now, online of his Monica, call like the influenza."
"What my influencer talked a lot about like, giving out information and breaking it down into like bite-size. No consumable format. And that was given by a father actually. Not really. I think I might be on my way. I just adopted it. I understand. I feel so right now which is a youth conference that I think that you motivate young people to pursue their passions to do any. All my free time into like my passions, which is all the things we the word Alpha. Sometimes it can have, you know, positive or negative connotations. And just a disclaimer, write these words used to describe animals in the animal kingdom, to determine their rankings in the past, and it may come as some sort of negative connotation when used on people. But I must result take it with a grain of salt and have an open and honest conversation."
"I think so. I think of that the face alpha male, you know, someone like Harvey Specter from the show Suits come to mine very like Macho, you know, very powerful. I don't think I have anything like that but no based on what people have told me and knowing myself as well. I do think that I'm quite time, a elephant. Yes. By like do I fit the image know? So that would be my answer was to be Alpha Taipei. I think that many characteristics that you know, after you do that too and it doesn't necessarily mean I know, you have to dress a certain way. So what do your friends and your colleagues say about you that conclude that you are more time. So one thing that I got inside internship days, what that I'm very go get there so I know exactly what I want and I won't stop until I get it."
"Another time. Is that, like a team is working on something like, naturally. I'll just slide my way into a leadership position. Making sure that like every"
"Another word for bossy. Yeah, but like, you know, if our group project and then I don't see it progressing a certain way on that fast enough, but I'm definitely stepping up and making sure that like, let's do a party mix. Making sure that we meet like the goals in the end. So I think that's why do you know what that what people see and what. So what I definitely noticed as well as talking to picking up from what you said, has anyone ever sit like that? People come to me. See if I can maybe don't be so like, you know, aggressive but mostly working with people around my teammate of the younger one. So, I would say that, that's why I need to balance being a friend and also like the little leader, right? So I do try to come across not to rely on route."
"Right in and I went well, I think you know you can ask Joakim is while he was one of our gas in the previous episodes. So when we first started out together as video pain is like he a hundred percent said that I'm always like kind of dominate everything and like I must always win in a discussion and I end up making all the decisions are definitely from his lands. He would think that I'm a alpha female along the years and along the way. I also realize that maybe I shouldn't be so aggressive. Like I can always come across my way all the time and I can always get things my way. So it's all about finding that balance, right? You know, they tell me that this is my working style and then this is and I know what my installers and I like to go into projects and I laying out there like hey, this is how I give it back. This is how I function like"
"Don't let don't take it personally for me. And why not? And then, that kind of, like, says expectations sometimes where buy different people come into a different project with different expectations, of course, you know, and sometimes they taking Philip, personally, and that's where things and, you know, go off Trail a little bit. So I do think I'm coming to get you in such a big part of that is well in an alpha male for example, but when you know, like for example, a girl comes into your work situation and comes across Alpha. People might be like, oh, she's such a bitch, people just dismiss a woman who's interested in my personal perspective. So, I mean, I work in meteorite, and I and I work with a lot of, like, women around the NFL in positions of power."
"What is quit of female-dominated? Some in some sections of the different types of companies within them. So I have been in an editorial publication. I've been in, like, influencer marketing and end in the mat. Not. So, in those times where I have been working under a female leader. I realize is that is not actually busy. You know, like it's just I see it as you know, someone who is confident that if but at the same time, oh, yeah, there's no way the way that the team of that. The people use a bit more human as a bit more like a caring factor to it and even under female for SSI in school where I went to be like at school and communication School, professors, even if they lead the class and the students along. I just always just kind of like empathetic"
"Do it, which I really really enjoyed. I think that that's why I thrive under agree with the fact that I owe any woman who is assertive is a bitch. Some people are busy but let you know like that in my experiences in school at work, a lot more care to to the way they handle work. So I can get something. I appreciate actually. Yeah, you know, in control control, street, whatever whatever which could then cause all these negative feelings by mail, like alpha males, who are indeed a ship positions. They are less emotionally involved in Memorial Surgical."
"That I had in there, but that's like, like, you know, at work and also in school. It's like, I definitely see the different types of leadership qualities coming to play. I mean, I personally don't like the gender stereotypes, but I see it. You know what, I'm going to look at like that the male lead us and in the way they delete certain things and also like the female leaders. I definitely see like that difference. Between OKC, 10 years, old, old school and then, you know, you go into. I went to party. So like why is that you get introduced to like a whole bunch of different people. And this is a self confession right here. When it was a group setting, kind of like group project, kind of thing. I was so irritated with the two, guys in my group because they would like a lazy ass bitches. And I was the one that you do this, you do that. And I'm pretty sure people were saying that I was a bitch. When you started doing all these like you do."
"Setting projects and stuff like that, and you exposed to more people did that also then change you or shit you as a person, when you enter the industry and started working. I mean, I wouldn't think of it as a gender kind of issue. I would think it's more just like, working with different types of personalities 100% off. So, I would say that the first couple of months and in JC where I eventually went from, like a boy school to kind of like a ghost with like, 10 goes around then, and just me and my other black male friend fast as I can. You do the way you taught you behave in class the way you talk in class, like, sometimes the things you say have to be have to be a lot more, like sensitive to do and things like that. I would say the environment very different and it's like a mini dirt bike, the guys, and also like teenage boys, who talks too much."
"Is it at least come back to my secondary school friend? You don't you do right people the wrong way and what? Now it's spelling things. You see. Do you find this Alpha trait attractive, or turn off? And this can be on a personal note to not just work. So I'm dating life to it, isn't attractive tree knowing how I am. Like as a person where I I I like it when I'm in control that I liked it. When I know what I want in it, when my goals are clear and how to get that clear. So, you know, I tend to surround myself with people like that. We just kind of like, you know, when you look at someone and they are kind of embodying, what you deserve what you want for yourself. Like that is attractive."
"Episode. I drop some light random time that I heard from somewhere. You are the equivalent or the average of the five people around you. If you want to surround yourself with that kind of a secret passage in your own personal life, to do for me. I feel like, okay. Generally, I am someone who wants to be in control of a lot of things of The Narrative of whatever, right? And I would also like to date someone who is a little bit Alpha and that's and I realize that, you know, after a lengthy dating life to do, where do people like really know anything. Let me know. I don't know. Like I know, we'll just go as we will live as we go or like, I don't know. Maybe I'll just find something else to do. What about you? I have seen, not just myself, but I seen so many relationships fail because one individual is ready to conquer and and you don't like a chief all the other than one, Indiana."
"Not, not that. That's wrong, right? Like, something personally. I don't think. So. I've seen so many relationships fail, simply because of that. So that then takes us to say, and knowing your current life situation and all that, right? Do you find like, let's say an alpha woman into anything. But what I feel about a situation whereby someone who's obviously in a woman walks into the room and I feel like, oh, no, you know, I what do I what what can I do? Like, how do I not look stupid in front of her? You know what, I don't think. It's also offer me as a mending intimidated by woman. I just think that it's me being intimidated by someone who is intimidating. You know, it's like it's just like if it's if it's a guy that comes in the same thing, so,"
"And I don't want to like, you know, like come across as like stupid or whatever. Then you ever made an opinion or make opinion known at a table and it was an unpopular opinion that needed to be improved. And sometimes that means that certain people have to pull up their socks, a little bit more people would rather just like Spike things under the carpet in my mouth."
"Who episode on? That is not really my style. I think that that they are Generation Y, where is ours is just going to let it all out then."
"Interesting point when you mention like the generation thing and I'll parents because this could also stem from a generational thing, sometimes seen as oh, yeah, okay, in control and all that. But females might come across a bit more negative because females are known to just be like, okay, I'll stay at home. Take care of the kid. Yeah, I won't worry, you know, I'm a housewife and everything. My husband want to do. I'll say OK, us. He's like this war between us and then, you know, what is an even now that still has some, you know, Echoes Echoes. So I was doing some reading before before. I remember reading this piece. That was by the psychologist out there. So they did a study found out was that female to have dominant attributes, attribute."
"Showing that it's normal that, you know, women can show these attributes of the role model data, can they can they can look up to exactly. So, you know, it's definitely like a parent thing. Like this definitely something that you called. So I would think that our generation submit mall at Progressive and attend. Because I would say that some of our parents, perhaps, you know, is that it to go through? I would say in the next wave, feminism. And then, and then they saw what glass ceilings I like. And then those values get passed down to us, right? And then I would like a future Generations will see a lot more of such growth and progress in a relationship. If you are dating, for example, and alpha female a girl that is independent and successful and financially independent. She doesn't mind. Also that contributing financially to the household and open my email."
"And for some guys, I don't know whether to them if he was a little bit. Like I don't know if I can handle that for me. I mean, I can name one or two guys that I did it before that were intimidated by my profession. And the things that I do you do at a much younger age back then when it just started out working, you know, Sunday or like, while I'm working or something. Yeah. And to, some of the guys there, Leo man, like, I don't think I can handle this cuz, like, I should be the one doing this. So why you always trying to take control of the situation and in those aspects that it didn't quite work out causes this whole situation, where you look for a partner who"
"Is able to handle that is also confident in himself and is comfortable for you to say a personal relationships. Have you ever been to visit by a partner or the other way around? I would like that reflected. The relationship. I'm in is one that is like a power couple kind of healthy and you know what? Like that lives together. And like I look at couples like that as well. And that is something that I would like to email 8 as well. So as I said, I look for someone who is like kind of like in line a line with what I what I want it to me, sometime as well to understand that whole concept."
"Have you things my way and having to give in a little bit? So I don't know. Cuz I'm like the only kid I go out with no surprise, given to the daughter. That's why she was the only kid 100% you do. And then even I guess is entering the Working World and stuff like that. It took me some time and I believe gross as well. You know, I'm a charity to get that for you. Do you think it took you also a little bit of time to understand? I hate, you know, I need to step back also and give other people a chance. I think that experience has changed me as an individual will be learning how to navigate situations like this. You know, what, learning how to walk in the team, learning how to make sure that you don't object, is coming met. And also the people that you work with you able to make sure everyone's happy at the end of the day. I be the skills that you can only go through when you go through them."
"Ask me a question, you know, it hasn't been over time. That tell me that you learned. I mean, I don't mean to say it that we obviously, but you know sometimes for for me is what was a learning experience to just not be so fiery. Like you don't involve. We don't see it from the Abode of perspective as well, and you're always starting your own Lantern. So, I mean, that can be a very challenging and you know how the government environment. So, we grew up watching all these men characters from 10. And then, you know, obviously it's fine for drama, but if we don't really realize that in the real world, sometimes the way we say things, and"
"And the way we express ourselves to people like on TV, I like Alexa Hut someone once and I am probably never going to do that again because I like they are real feelings involved in that like other people that are around you. Everyone is living the life, you know, so so that's where I live. Just you lessons that could have also caused a shift in the way people. See females who are in power in control of everything, is put in front of fly. Rule tinted glasses. Where is it? Real life is like it's not really that way."
"I have like how your behavior can affect those around there. Anything else that you want to add on when it comes to communication or being in? You do the walking in the street eating with being surrounded by a lot of independent people and yourself included wrong with it. And sometimes, you know, we see how people like celebrated with young people. Don't like it at the end of the day. It's like just making sure that you do. And I'll and you're working with the people around you, you're surrounded by other individuals. Like make sure that, you know, Su Alpha Legend on Alpha. You make sure that you respect people in the way you are and we still have a lot of empathy in the way you do things and entry other people, then I think that like all will be good. It doesn't matter if you're outside."

How do you feel about the episode that we're going to cover today? Are you a little bit nervous? I am actually wrote the key point, though. I think answering them will be a little bit. I'm get shy because it's very personal thing. They stopping people, place importance on wedding night and it is going to be very useful for those who are looking to get married soon myself."
"But do not ask you, it's your idea wedding and, you know, being a hose and heading hosted, 20 /, 330 wedding, the wedding on the wedding night, right? I wouldn't, I, I just wanting to see all the day of the wedding, write the two people who are the most high. It is, if anybody else finally finish, whatever you had to do it for the day, you finally at the chain, all your gas, you know, and then you get back to the hotel room for the energy to do anything else, right? So this is my idea of a wedding night, cuddles, and rest, very realistic. I love that."
"Play idea of the wedding, Miami hotel room, or the room service and count my money tonight. So, what happened was my parents had brought it home, and we went to a couple of days and then I open the package."
"Are we we cannot hear from Ashley, from producer and decided to give us the official definition of wedding night in dictionary. What does it mean? It is the night of someone's wedding."

It's called, am I the only one who haven't seen it. I think we have all seen it but has or has not seen till the end. So let's not spoil it for me to must make haste."
"Don't you guys think that this concept of what Unity favors the men because there's no way of telling this is with regards to like do you bleed your first time? You don't bleed you're probably not something to tell in the 1800's virgin and pure India, let you know, it's okay if you high and not like Ruben is a question cuz I didn't I didn't also. Maybe you guys can you get this? Many ways will happen to be broken. You could have literally been like on a bicycle pump."
Official location riding a bicycle on the bicycle is go sister. Official location with strings.
"Do you think, do you think like a woman should stay a virgin until they get married? I think this is purely personal choice, and I don't think there's any right or wrong because it's your body and you have the right to her to do whatever you want. But even make you happier to only give it away. After you get married, then by all means, go ahead. Yes, I believe. I believe in opening up my options, you know, I've been eating exploring before I come to a decision Thursday. I don't want to sound like it is important. That wasn't exciting. No Festival. I've said before on the podcast that the day before my wedding, I started bleeding."
"All around. Audrey, the everybody. That's number one. And then number two was that it's really, really tiring. So I didn't go and leave before I got married. So I can measure it. Saturday Friday is the only day that I was on leave. And the very next Monday. I was back at work and this woman had like the Singapore. Yeah. It was, how many people I had over 2,000? Guess we could wait times when people get time."
"It basically ran from 10 a.m. To 8 p.m. We and his friends went to hang out and then we went back to the room. I tell you while we didn't even get to look at like post that people tagged Us in we didn't even look at pictures. It was immediately 10. Bye. Bye. Goodnight. See you tomorrow. Wow, well done.

"Welcome back to something private, a podcast of Southeast Asian women, by Southeast, Asian, women, exploring conversations around Health, the South community and left. My name is Nicole, and I am your producer and host."
"Before we set off to this episode. I like to give a special shout-out to our friends at the National University of Singapore, or any shorts for teaming up with us on an episode of March, being the dedicated, man for women. I'd like all of you ladies tuning in to think about yourself. And for the men to think about all the women in your life. This is saying that everybody in"
Who in your family makes sure that everybody's cancel and say who are the two women running one of Singapore's. First Healthcare programs focused on women's health. So I'm wondering.
"Be a bit too young for this young lady. Has a feeling congested in the chest. I mean you really confused by actually need something or getting a stress-related cardiomyopathy October cardiomyopathy. We really mean it like that. Your heart is really getting injured at a point in time. Do University, Heights Center, Singapore. Take care of matters of the heart."
"What's a Pikachu? Randy when it's hot health program? We've got nurses. And I'll just buy this program came about was because we find that we need to increase visibility of HUD housing, women and address this knowledge Gap that women don't know that you can die from that. Are you me? Aha who eventually died of cardiovascular condition, for what? It is. Women are not peeking out the ideas and looking out for me for the hell. But when you see women, women's heart health program, the things that represent that's that's basically the meaning"
"I think I've never heard before besides a similar condition affect both men and women but a skew towards like one particular gender, especially the western conference, right, you know more things like feminist movement, women's rights, who got a little bit to live somewhere where women can come to and really just get there. A hot check would definitely take care of meds. Talk to Health in Exeter Academy."
"Speak for a lot of girls my age. When I say that the term kind of flies with my right things to do when you're young. You're very you just focus on things that you do you unlike now and you get benefits, I do this, I go to gym that look told you about long-term Investments and you're talking about things that you cannot see, and sometimes it may make you, you may have to do like, have some sacrifices cuz like maybe our friends smoke healthy behaviors and you probably will also want to do it. So for you and they itch. Usually, when a young, it's just not something really a very big time rush, heart disease. The mini mini condition says, anything that can affect the heart which is like a pump and then the blood vessels. So, together the vessels and the"
"So it can range from things as simple as like high blood pressure, which can damage your vassals. If it's damage to the brain, can get things like Strokes of his stomach to your heart. They can get things like how to text. So it's it's really a big range passing. Generally when you taught me that in terms of media and people are discussing when it's a hot. I think people are thinking about how to texture my going to get this condition called coronary artery disease. That means this disease to the blood vessel specifically feeding the heart conditions appear. So, it really means that we can take action for Mom when I lived longer, right? I don't have to care that much if we want to change that notion."
"Number one, killer of men and women who are like everybody else. You think that references, the one who choose you, right? That gives you the best is always taking attention away. So I do feel that we've been associated with the hearts of inside a, but it really goes a long way because women generally live longer than men and so, if you are not taking care of your heart, you actually live with the burden of these much longer, and it's very hot to see. You want to look healthy as you healthy, if your heart is not in good shape. It's pretty common in the medical setting. When we have to propose day and intervention."
"Condition. One of the first things I need to ask my husband because I have everybody else has a medical appointment. If they can, send your children for sports classes, for cardiac Rehabilitation lady, who is she's not 20. She's 60 60, 60 class with a severe form of a heart condition. That causes the right after heart to fail. And she said she needs to have expected. I mean, to have to pull off his condition called hypertension. And and and I also put that turkey to her. She was actually very adamant against accepting any more therapy for heart condition because she feels that life is not worth the cost of the medication."
"And I remember, it wants to be very emotional for me because I almost had a whole back by kiss in the clinic to remain professional, but she keep money. You need it for your children's education. I don't have to leave too many more years and I have everything that I have and I think to do that is so sweet that that women to attend to put everybody else before themselves. They like to see themselves as a rule of the provider in the family and if Danny can go first,"
We talked about all the things that I know is a reflection of your inner self.
"All the women in my life. Everything about my mom also, like all the emotional burdens are scary, for my dad, my sister and wait for you to support, everyone wants to reach out to women to advocate for themselves. And the good thing about getting educated about is that if she knows how to have a good healthy lifestyle. She actually prints it. For the entire family is great. There is definitely a lot of literature about biological differences between men and women health care. So for example to the hospital later, they tend to live longer before coming to the emergency department."
"Business women more than men. And on top of that. There are like Gods wanting a coronary artery dissection of microvascular angina medical assistant. Heart condition. Can I do with preserved ejection fraction, or if a few any chance? Give me help Wendy."
"I'm wondering what's the reason for these two are not getting for women in South Asia and the concept of getting a heart attack while having a heart disease in your head and seek treatment. And is believed, to be honest, that I have. This lady was like, maybe fifty or sixty years old, and then we will tell her or let you know, you. You have online heart disease. Maybe got picked up on the stress, has, or maybe after a heart attack. And then, usually, after that, the always say, like, how can you be? I'm always well before that. And I didn't have anything before that. That's why we were saying, you need to really stop from when you're young cuz all these disease processes might have thought that when you're 20 or 30 and 40 and you just gradually wasn't and the other reason for us having this gender Taylor program is there are other specific risk factors in women if you have"
"Gas station with diabetes. So I think we need the education. And awareness part is how we may not coming for Finn. And secondly, women these days are really very busy careers, your family, just too many things to many things in it that that that Poppy. I have just simply get so lucky, you don't see it. And then when it comes to doctors turning away,"
"But I'll see a lot of times. It's just human nature, to be quite quick to judge. I'll share something personal that. Even myself, even though I'm have this program. It's just a very, very self-conscious like is patient, who was very, very anxious to know before that. She was. She's got anxiety disorder and depression. Struggling a bit with some alcohol is a difficult thing. She's about fifty plus years old and have the referral letter was from a gp40 set that, you know why, I think this woman is just, it's just menopause or she's just anxious. But since she keeps coming back, I think I'll just refer her to you the contacts and all these supposed to impression. You get things like, okay. This one sounds like"
"What kind of ice just pissing all over her face and she kept asking questions and he had all the previous tests and everything, just do a stress test for her butt in my hair, and then 2 weeks later, she came back and then turns out order, the stress test that are running test. Turn positive. I didn't write her off but I was really guilty cuz inside you know, charging her as well. She's just being anxious. She's going through menopause and I've done test on women which I expect to tell them that we should do this again just to make sure."
"And she said, I'm leaving and I cannot sleep at night. So I'll say, okay, that's how I was completely unnatural process of grieving, but he actually has very severe coronary artery disease and it was degrees and stress reaction a product because we didn't return to women. Generally tend to have symptoms, listening, a doctor to 21 to address a probability route to decide that we better with these people. So I think"
"What is not in the head then for both the patient and the providers. And basically can identifying heart disease in like, men and women. With the program provided, the doctors are generally more aware, that we shouldn't have any Healthcare disparities mentioning that came in menopausal symptoms for menopause. I want the classic symptoms is hot flashes."
"Sensation coming up my check so that always frequently gets mistaken by save us. So I can be either way in a minute to call me with your not coming to see that. I think I have a ugly. I'm stressed out and depressed. I I I think I saw the heart, but I just thought I'd take the gastric pill, trying to convince themselves and flashes as well."
"It seems like there's a bit of a meeting between psychological Health depression. So is that like a link directly? I'm stressed and unstressed at 4 cause my heart and it's not as simple as that and we do know that lost his emotions and almost having human right and down that things happen, you know, but if it's past history and if it's chronic, it feel like in a chronic state of stress and long-term depression, never getting better. It's more likely that you going to make for health choices. So that's a very stressed and people be like stress, eating a few, very fatigued, and lethargic doing an exercise, or maybe he might have insomnia with all these things in between, or like, conditions, where the thief is not stressing you sleeping."
"More likely to get things like high blood pressure and then high blood pressure. Increases your risk of getting hot. I don't think we need to be too worried. You know, when you're having stress for exam, I think increases the risk of heart attacks in women compared to 2.6 times. I have a higher tendency of lapsing into depression, compared to men, electrical sex differences, that makes women more vulnerable. And I've also been studied and designed to see if a stress are more likely to cause a heart attack."

"I want to get down to find me talking about what are the symptoms of cardiovascular disease. I think the truth is that he can be quite hard to tell the difference. The most common ones that, you know, about how to taste. You know, we have a chest pain TV show. Start in supposed to have to experience this. They do women tend to have a lot of atypical symptoms. So it's becoming it's just my size, So it could be simply a feeling heavy Sensational, ization a test. I just filling more to hire. Some people will have things like what do you say heartburn? That's why they're saying, it's gastritis."

That isn't really a cat like you know, what? Yes and no, this is symptom of heart disease or it's not. So I think they're the point that if it's something different from your usual and you're worried enough, he should just come get it checked. It's a difference between condition of the actually very similar, in terms of distance ties between very fast. I mean, cold sweat. Some people are hyperventilating and brief and you can have this chest pain and palpitations at essentially about the same but I think contact is very important. So if let's say You are young,"
"You're going to have an exam. You are stressed in all them. It's more like me and then when you take a break and come down, it's fine. But I'll see if maybe you have some risk factors for high blood pressure. If some family history of someone having maybe a stroke or heart disease and then you get this and you're not really facing any stress than a casino. You should be thinking more of a heart attack. I mean, these are two very extreme different examples of Allie about she she has right. So I think it's better to just get a baseline find out. Find out your respective, get a check. I think is nothing wrong with that even though I might get some people might be a bit embarrassed if she may be invited to any of that. But I think it's the right move to in or just come and get it checked."

Not the radio, the real partner."
"Anyway, I'm today's topic is really interesting. Cuz I think, you know, between couples, we always have discussions like this. And on top of that, we've had some arguments over this as well. All about communication today. So I'd say no communication. It spans across a very broad, very white, but effective as well because it can be text messages that can make a baby, speak to control expression, text messages for me to text messages."
"So maybe you could give our audience a quick introduction on how we met. Okay. So so we met on the YOLO Cruise, very Millennial. You only live once it's a singles cruise. We were both death. I happen to see her on the ship and I thought it was pretty cool. Girl stuff that chatting her up and the more I spoke with the more I found her appealing, funny, very funny, make me laugh. And then after that basically kept in touch and the rest is history. Can you believe it's been like three or three years since we met?

And I want to just keep talking over, and over and over again, just so, you know, get through and every time we argue, I'm not sure if you you feel this, but I'm like fix it now. Looks like talk to me, talk to me and you're just like, I think that's true to form NY, at least for me. Sometimes, I just want some quiet time in headspace to digest. I do consult some of my guy friends from time to time but not not often because I feel like maybe it's the guy you so called."
"Meant to deal with it and not really big help for it. Could be a sign of like weakness option but I do speak with friends. I asked him for advice, but generally I can see that is very obvious for girls. They will need to talk about being in a little jewelry. FYI, chatting with my best friend's, you know, where my best girlfriends, my best friends as well, and we can spend 6 hours chatting about the same problem.

The same. But I also like to give you stuff surprises little notes. I love that. That's really nice. I like that you brought up this early on that. I want to"
"This is on, you said that guys are men rather. Sometimes they might be expected to not seem emotional or not want to and not appear to ask for help. Because it may not seem like manly enough due to all the societal expectations. So, do you think it is largely due to societal perceptions that you also, as a result have you don't have grown up thinking like I must, you know, maintain this certain image. I shouldn't ask for help that the influence, all that expectation. I mean, does the phrase man of the house. Already said it? All right, that face implies that the man is in charge and has the responsibility of looking after everything to sort everything out. But then as we as we progress in time in her, now that may not necessarily have to"
"Because I think women are so capable. I mean many working moms and more capable of more than capable of being in Owen in charge. And so this responsibility of being in charge. I feel should be share, right? There's no need to place all that emphasis on on, on the man and giving him that treasure little cameo in the first episode."
"Now don't get me wrong. I really like my job. I enjoy what I do, but, you know, someone's got to take one for the team, right? And if on scan done Mall, why not? And I guess since, when can I quit"
"How to see your very, you know, you think very differently. I mean so it's quite refreshing to hear that too. And by the way, it's totally okay. If you ever need to cry cuz I don't think I've ever seen him cry. I never seen you cry cry but you see me cry like a million times over the smallest things. I watching Love Island. I cry. Even when I watch movies, just that you don't know."
"Also when I think that you're fixing your glasses, you're actually wiping the weird. So I'm going to move on to the report and wrap all style cuz we're saying that the way that men communicate with your life. Why, why is it that, you know, we were not the same when it comes to this mode of communication. I don't know. I think it's"
"Programming, but we just get kind of like straight to the point. If you think. I, I, I am quite short and Shop. I think he's Tuesday. I have friends who are even, like, less worthy than me. A lot of me, but you see the settings. Sometimes the Cape May be like this behind."
"Tell me when people just put this on like now, I did not even know. What do you think that your mode of communication matches mine? Because you said that I'm more worthy of more emotional. I'm more, I don't know. I beat around the bush sometimes so maybe on text. I could be a little bit more aware that you think I am. I can be quite direct and could. So sometimes I softened it with Emojis. Are I never used any of you?"
"So yeah, I try to be aware that but sometimes when I'm rushing like I need to reply Shopkin, this is where I would say. What I like about us is that we call each other in this video. So, I know that there's some people who hate phone calls on the find. It abrasive Define it confrontational whenever you receive a phone call to see what I do wrong. Like why is someone on the phone talking late into the night is Wyatt?"
"That was not okay. It's not on the wall. But now you guys just text and yes, we call each other. When, when, when is OJ. And I like that, and call me and we chat catch up on each other's day is a long drive. So happy to gain her. That's what I like about him being with. You has kind of trained me to utilize phone calls a little bit more as well, which I personally like because obviously a very vocal person. I like to play it as it is and we'll collect my feelings as well forces text, which can be misconstrued, a lot to be misconstrued, have any of your ex-girlfriends other people around. You haven't given you feedback that your text messages can be quite scary or nobody has ever said that."
"Actually come to think of it. No one has already said that but I think my my team my team would have something to say about that. Let's call them for the next episode. I can be quite direct and I admit that. So blah, blah, blah blah, blah. Boom, Atkins on daughter quarterback."
I walk in the room.
"Greek writing. So from that has there been a time where we had, you know, that say a small to that sort of escalated to a really big and you can't remember off the top of your head, like, you know, something small that. But I do remember one time we were talking about something and then you like you're angry is it? I'm not angry, angry, man."
"And the more she says, I'm angry."
What do you say? I'm angry?
"Cuz it was really a nothing, nothing. I don't even remember the, the reason why I thought you were angry."
"I don't remember. It is a perfect example of an argument about nothing but really, really about communication that argument did not end. Well, in the initial in the initial game, is it ended with some someone leaving the situation and closing, the door will be left to cool down while I was just simmering in it."
"How do you resolve it in the end? It we just stepped out and decided like, I know we talked about it being in the situation like that when things escalate irrelevant stuff, get brought into the theme. To the argument. We recognize that after cooling down. I think having some headspace helps. And then coming back when we are cool down to actually talk about it so important but having time in Isuzu equally important. Didn't walk through what actually is the issue and then talk calmly about it. A lot as well in the few years that we've been together. I think I've matured a little bit too, because possibly, when we first started going out, I don't know it. Whenever we had an argument. I might be very hot here."
"But, you know, let's just take some space. That you do want to say things that you regret like in an argument and stuff. And I think I've learned that from you as well, to really just so, you know, down a little bit and then Force the apologize. Because, in every argument, I feel we both might have said, hurtful things all. We both might be in the wrong to some extent and the fact that, you know me, I know that you did it, when I ask you, like, why you mad, are you angry? When you are. So he also explained to me that it could be me projecting my unhappiness on to him, when I asked him, are you at happy? Because I'm actually the one that is upset with the situation or how the situation panned out. So it's been studied about this ego projection, something for Saturday, quite quite relevant. Make an effort to communicate."
My language a little bit more as well. Maybe we need a date night or something. It's not just like so cold and straight to the point where you want to go. It's not like that. He actually makes the effort to plan the place in order to book the restaurant and and also plan maybe like a little day out and he will communicate that to me on text and because you're so organized and practical she sent it out. So we're going to do this. We're going to do this with the rest of you. The end. What do you feel about? This is great. I can just relax and go along with your friend. So is it. Okay. We're going to do this far. Did I appreciate that? You have evolved?
"In our relationship communication that listens. Well, I think at the get-go we were already kind of like 80% that the rest is all fine-tuning. And for me, it has been, actually, the difference will inherently be? There is just that finding that bridge and even this bridge into the communication is not just between genders, but it was so across the age gaps. So finding that bridge, the ability and the platform for which you can come and have an exchange of ideas in rational Mutual fashion. That is essentially communication, you know, many different diverse couples as well. I think that is so important to treat it as a learning Journey. Between the two of you, like, in a relationship. We are so constantly learning about our communication differences."
"And how we make it better as well. I think, you know, it's always good to check in on yourself to like talk about these things. You don't see a counselor. If you think that perhaps you know that the breakdown is to read either and you can't solve it between the two of you. I think there's nothing wrong with also seeking for a professional help or like a third person point of view such as a fresh perspective as well, neutral third-party environment, like deescalate the situation. Best friend of mine recommended communication style of writing. Let's see if there's an argument. He recommended writing. All your thoughts down. Don't send that email that to immediately come back and read it maybe a day later, and then certain things. I'm sure, they will be things on it and then send it. So, it gives the reader the chance to digest, all the feeling that one go, because if that was communicated live, the person might interject. So I thought that was quite an interesting idea."
"My next question, which was, you know, if you had any advice for couples, have communication issues, which I think you can read my mind. We did this before when we wrote down, what I like about you, and what I really can't stand about you, but I think we did this 2 years ago, was it when we had a, we had some solve an argument as well, and if it helps because, you know, it was plain blank, black and white in your face. What I love and what, I don't know, so much about you and it, we fix it from there. That's a safe to say that we addressed 90% of 80%. And 80% of it. I'm still a little bit of respite from their heads. I need that gives the ability to see each other's point of view and I think that's what's important in romantic relationships, but also interpersonal relationships as well, and you're lonely and packing and dissecting one segment of communication today. I wish we really had more time cuz I think there's so many"
"Subcategories of this topic that we can go in through but just do wrap things up. I would say, any last words that you want to leave, you do for our listeners for audience today is just a clear that the most important form of how people exchange ideas right now in communicating with a partner or a relative or a colleague."
"Sometimes it's quite important to be to be conscious and aware and I felt like it was helpful. When you when you told me how I may appear to be. And so, so then that gives me some feedback on an ability to adjust. And if you hadn't told me that I wouldn't know, so I think it's always quite helpful to always ask for some feedback so that we can always improve. Yeah, maybe don't ask how or whether you're angry."
"Thank you so much for being on this episode with me. I think it was a very interesting experience, a marrying, a personal thoughts to do on this video and for an audience as well. So make sure you get your office manager to send an invoice to me later. Okay, I will leave a comment cuz I will be interested to hear what you think as well."
"He's recording recording, audio of a job. I enjoy what I do, but you know, someone's going to take one for the team, right? And I guess."
"What's up? I'm sorry to in the day. I'm a presenter and entrepreneur and at night, sometimes I'm an over-thinker, which is why I'm on this flight test and hosting. You are a very first episode of Men explain. It's a podcast where we really unpacked different perspectives. And I'm going to be talking to guys of many different backgrounds, occupations from all walks of life. Basically, and I feel like on behalf of my sister. I want to thank the men, especially kids. Use our very first guests for coming on board, to explain the psyche and some of the questions that had questions that us girls have at times that we don't really get a solid answers for it. So no pressure at all. All men. My thoughts are just me, but my name is Gigi and I am actually with what"
"Banana a YouTube channel. I do my own YouTube channel as well. But mainly I create content on YouTube, Instagram and I will call myself a freelancer, the pandemic, when it first hit, right, understatement. Yeah. Yeah, and then, did you feel kind of like a little bit insecure during that time, like, worried anxious, stuff like that insecure. And you see a specialty my bodice you working from home and my mom's like housewife and what you doing? What's up? So I'm just trying to create content home which is not easy money for that because there's no more clients and everything, but I think that's when I started doing twitch for me. So I guess we always go to like, try to like find new ways to like"
"I need my boyfriend became a photographer. So I mean that's also improvising on everything because we want to talk about running power. Okay, and I think in our society, we're kind of boring into the Direction Where We realize a lot of women around as and I myself am noticing this as well, even as a woman, a lot of my girlfriends to becoming very ambitious. They're very successful in your own right now and more than ever at a very proud and alive, if you know that you would like to talk about their business, their successes and stuff like that. So in this day and age, how would you feel dating a woman that owns more than you blessed?"
"Housing, but coming from my perspective, because I'm a freelancer, to be honest. I don't like not advise. They wouldn't come in Singapore. Can you put on Moana me? Know, I would really be blessed if if a girl would actually wouldn't mind dating me in the first place, you know, but I always feel is not really, I don't think it's like a man thing, more, like a woman's thing where you do a woman. Wouldn't want to date a guy shot and how a woman wouldn't want to be, maybe I feel, I feel like a guy I'm down with it. Okay, if she's calling me, let's go. I don't mind."
"We have no respect that. You don't have a single and I think it's most likely very possible that in the future. I didn't want you and Mona me. Okay? Yeah, so holla cuz I feel like this entire 5 minutes. He was like I'm single."
"That's all I got from that covers. It's a maybe, or maybe other guys. I don't have these conversations because when I talk to my girlfriend, we have like ours, our conversations about about guy than I don't know, as overthinking and all that. I don't know what kind of conversation is, guys, have behind closed doors or when you guys catch up, but has one of your guy friends ever encountered something like this and was uncomfortable with it. I think that is a story where because one of my guy friends that you'd obviously, it's like, not that much. She said, she's working in her own family business or his income easily. So, for his case, he has food a fact of it, but why he does is it and everything, so he can stay home. I want to see, he's not entirely effective."
"If I just stay home, you know, I don't think it affects him like his men."
"That is a huge Paradigm Shift, you know where women are like coming out, stepping out in like to be independent. You know, I want to be my only boss. I didn't catch that lady. Posting very strong bad for him."
"I think it's it's like I got to go back to the first one was like I think he's okay, but his mouth how other people see it, be able to accept it also and work it out with your partner. Feel like some women actually downplay their wealth to make a house for a couple of days now and in a while, I think I think I'll definitely let you know that there's a slight pain in me for dinner. But thank you. You should buy dinner. No, no speed, interviews 5, but I think it's more trying to protect the guy Eagle. Okay. Yeah, I will be maybe a bit grateful for"
"But then I actually, I was dating somebody. He is not married with twins. By the way, if you ever are now married with kids, most of them, so I'm pretty much a Good Luck Chuck. Have you watch that movie? That's a mean, take away from us. So it was interesting because, you know, back then when I first started getting into this business, right? I really honestly worked very hard in the end. I know you do but, you know, as you know, when you just start writing me to go to hustle anybody, somebody"
"Waiting on one of his friends weddings, you know, I meant a lot of people and they were from a different industry. That's completely different from ours. So I won't say what industry. But you know, they have zero idea of what I actually do. So a lot of people at all. So what do you really do like on a daily basis? And somebody asked how much do you earn like somebody just spend it on the table and the asked on average? Let's see. If you do like a event has not been let you know, you do a lot of stuff back to back. So I just threw out a random number and they want to see, like they were shocked. And you like, why what, what, what in the world do you do to, like, be able to let you know that much? Because I think at that point, a lot of them were on the same age as me as well, and they were just, you know, getting into their business, right? It was due like growing and stuff. So it's too damn. It was a little bit like, what? Like, I don't think what you do. Deserves that kind of money. It sounds like it was totally different skill, you know, so at the same time, that was an uncomfortable situation cuz"
"The guy that was dating back then is like 8 years older than me. And so I think at that point even though eventually he's definitely going to be raining a lot more at that point to hear that. He's much younger. Girlfriend was also running around the same as him. All those years older than me. I think to the whole table was a little bit like shocking, right? And it kind of got a bit uncomfortable seeing something is too close to the truth. So, you know what? I mean? I don't know. Any thoughts that run through my mind sometimes, how would I have done it differently. How would I have dealt with it differently in relationships? I know because of the fact that we have a lot of prep to do, you know where things can go wrong during a live show. That's the reason why not. Everybody can do what we do it. Like I for sure can do what they do, right? So that's a tough one. Like, I don't know."
"To protect my partner's interest. I should have done. Paid it. We never downplay betrayal play what? I think it's nice things about that aspect. Yeah. Yeah. It's like this one kind of address in the beginning. But do you think it's more common than you think? I do think in Singapore contact? Yes, because first of all, I know we have to send you one of the same experiences and everything, but I don't know where"
"That said, the woman said they make the same under husbands or Partners in the year 2020. That's really recent. By the way, because in this wonderful today, I don't know what you find out. Definitely inordinate, you know, because I think we're going to take me to try it, more like millennial generation and stuff. I'm very comfortable with sharing with my current partner, and certain things as well. Cuz I think we're at the stage where we do want to settle down. You know, we do want to talk to each other about these things. So like you said, do you think it's very important that you have these conversations before you settle down with someone or is it too tight?"
"Accommodation, do people still keep no secrets here and that you think, you know, it's like for the future. I mean, do you want to kiss me? If you can have kids, who's going to stay home? When you decide to stop by? Cuz you kind of need to know. So who's going to so-called maybe take a step down from the job. I'll take a message with look on your job because if her Joplin's more money than that, just makes more sense in a way. I don't know. But definitely must have conversations. We have such conversation and we don't fight. But, you know, where is soldiers to everybody fights like a lot of the time, right? You know, you kind of get into a tie for tense environment in conversation, right over money issues."
"Never really was still light grinding it all in, just waiting on you to come here. So I did tell this girl that I was dating at the time 2:00. I kind of want to like cuz you was seeing. You know what? I think. I bet I think is wonderful with my light off. Like I kind of need to focus on my career. Now, you know, any videos I taken today."
"To give me an allowance. Wow, that is interesting. You wouldn't like something for sure. She's actually,"
"I think, I think for my perspective as I got older but then I didn't, I didn't, I didn't take off her. How can I accept allowance for me to go? So, I wasn't too effective that she wasn't. I wasn't too affected that she, she's very successfully the job, but I was affected when she kind of got offered this gesture. It would put in a different angle different. She said it differently think having different she offered."
"Good looks so, so, so so, so, how much did she offer? Four digits? Let you know, waiting between speed of 40 K. Okay, but I feel like if things would be different, like maybe if you would like solid in a relationship like that one was a real Beauty was like to get a month or two. So maybe there's been like yours and she knows that how hard I've been working on my career and she offered this things would be different if you get a deeper connection and from that, you know, you know that she loves you for who you are and she knows what you do, what she wants to support you for you. So I don't, you want to hang out."
"And you might feel like indebted to her in some way, which you don't want someone that you just met wanted two months ago and didn't know it. Would you rather be relied on or would you rather rely on a? My, I mean, in in a perfect world? Yeah. Yeah, but personally."
"Madison, if you will allow me, I mean, I guess always good and bad things to ever used for and I like to be the one like always, you know, needing to pack. And let you know that I think was my mom or something. That said this, she's also a Capricorn. She said, I know that you always like to be, you know, like to put a strong front and stuff like that, but sometimes, it's okay to let people help you or let people get away and I think she's also kind of suppliant thing. Like, you know, it's okay to rely on your partner sometimes because I've been such a okay. It is in my nature to be a bit more independent. And also, I mean, I'm going to child, you know, I do support my parents to and as a result when I'm in a relationship, I can't be that same person. I'm very independent. I very like I can buy this on my own."
"Oh, yeah, I like that watch. Yeah, I'm going to get it or, you know, stuff like that. And I don't need am not going to ask you to buy me gifts or like do this and that for me or I'll get it know that kind of thing. So, I don't know whether that has hurt my relationships as well at some point in time like making my partner feel less significant or less important. I don't know, the guy who needs to step up his game. I got I'm only going if you want to be before you have to like be on her level or even more, you know, you cannot be like she's like you have to chase her but helping her, you know, I wouldn't want to be like you."
"1 days, I will try to find something that she would like a new one and I think that's the beauty of it."
Why you still single?
"I feel quite quite understanding. You know, you're very open-minded. You, I mean, like, is it? Is it cuz you're not looking or what's going on? Stop some Navy people. Okay. Yeah. I'm at home with a bank account. And, you know, we don't mean you people, it's better for me tonight. And if you do meet new people is like, somebody, not like, I'll be discreet and to all so-called taken on that. All that happy. No, no, no, no. No, this is not about me. Finding a partner. May be also asked if you would date someone who has more than you might. But what if you're in a situation where you are so passionate about your job. I mean, I'm not sure how long you see yourself doing being in this industry. And which also"
"Always question. You can't answer that. Say your super passionate about this, even though the ups and downs and our industry and you are. So you're so much fire for this job that you fancy yourself doing it for the Knicks like 10-20 years, you evolve Fitness industry and your female partner is running significantly more than you. And you are expected to give up your job at some point to take care of the household. You touching his other on about your friend, but you personally, would you be able to do that?"
"Okay, so I need a Something Beautiful about my job. And what I do, as a content creator is it doesn't matter what I do, but that's always good content. You know, if I have to stay home, be a single father single. There's money to be made that. That's not at all. House has been all day. So that's four."
"Content creation, you know, but if you talk about like, I have to give up to HR to give up like YouTube because realistically, I mean, I have the time for it and because my wife doesn't like you being on social media Partners who are not comfortable with my baby to the world. Oh my God, if your love is that strong in your bond, is that strong and you're like I want to do is raise this family. I want to say yes now but"
"I think it's, I would try to find a miracle, you know, I can give up some things but I don't think I can ever fully give up. But in the meantime, I'm also still with your sister. No, no, no, you have to give up everything, then. Maybe I want to say yes, and I think I would say yes and when she asked me, but I did a little bit of me with. You know, and I know and I think if she's my wife and she really wants me to be happy and she loves you. She loves me. She would kind of be honest. And, you know, I would say yes, and maybe if you have time with my child's growing up with more free time, maybe I can pursue what I love again."
"You don't need any more money. Yeah, yeah."
I think you're not my money.
"But I think so. I hope we keeping his punk ass meme after this. Thank you so much for sharing your personal stories. Cuz I I feel like sometimes maybe you don't do you want to like open up too much about all these things on a public platform. So I'm very grateful for that. Right? So I had to ask my boyfriend if we were married and if I'm owning more than him, he had to quit his job, to take out the family. Would he do it? So it to give me some contacts, he is actually 14 years older than me and, you know, so we are at I don't know what I would say. Like, we're a different phases cuz if we were different phases we wouldn't be dating. Cuz I feel like dating is all about being in the same phase of life, right? So maybe cuz you know, I can just grab a lot faster to we get exposed to a lot more things and perhaps that's why. So I don't know. But yes, I'll be here like he's full view of this see if you responded."
"He's recording recording audio to, oh my God, it's killing me recording. Audio is killing me by 30 second. Audio. Recording has come through. Shall we share it? Okay."
I hope he doesn't sound boring.
"So the question is, if we got married and my partners anymore, and I had to quit my job. What would I do? That, would be yes. Okay, now don't get me wrong. I really like my job. I enjoy what I do, but, you know, someone's got to take one for the team, right? And if an unmarked, why not? And I guess when can I quit"
Isle of the Lost.
"That was supposed to be. Okay, I love it. Yeah, me too. He's a keeper. Yeah, I think so too. I actually didn't invite you. Ask my parents if we actually found online. Okay. Listen to this. OK, Google. When I started dating my girlfriend, she made significantly more than I did. So she was the one who paid for meals out things occasions. Now I make significantly more than she does. So the roles are reversed at no point in time. Did I ever feel emasculated by the arrangement? If you need the power to a financially, dominating your significant other than what you have as a pet."
"Not a partner. Do you agree with that financially dominating? What you have is a pet. Okay. S with you. My wife and significantly more than me when we started dating. It was more than two times. What I learned that after a few years ago, that reduced to a little under two, the disparity has created a bit of stress on her. Since she ends up taking the majority of our family financial commitments, which I have absolutely no issues with me anymore. So it's kind of similar to what you're saying. This is a more modern perspective compared to our parents right back in the day. Honestly, I would ever lie to my significant other about how much would you with you if you felt like it might make her feel better on the floor."
"For the greater good, you would."
"You do know how to cook. You know, I'm not saying it right now, baby diapers. Before I said, guys have adopted the role where you don't feel like cooking when I get a dog. Like can you clean up the poop and everything? And I'll just you know, I mean"
"It's an interesting perspective regardless, and I'm so glad that you and also Jeremy you're kind of on the same page two, very different points of view of a good point as well with the role as being a little bit more. Reversed majority of my girlfriend's don't cook. Don't want kids would not also clean up after their dogs. So the conclusion is he's not dating any of my friends. Do you have any words of wisdom to impart to our audience, before we wrap it up today? And I do think that this this whole podcast is so where were we watching? His home is very interesting and typically in the back of my head. I told you I'll be there at 1. I thought I thought this is the only way I think because of what I do, as a content creator by hearing"
Preston from what your boyfriend said that he's like from a typical working industrial job and he didn't mind it. And
"Things have really changed. I know, you know, like the perspective of people have change and if you still think that we've used to like feel like insecure about it. I know I'm a guy, I'm going to open your eyes a little bit in a form female perspective, from a guy perspective that you know, we have created like we're on equal ground. I don't see myself as Sin, man. I do better than you. I think it has become like a woman can do as much as even better than guys in certain aspects of life. And money is one thing where I think woman. Is there any better I buy launch listing some of the expenses 100 listings."

How do you say the high desert?
"And this is part two of this episode. What we want. This is what our parents want. I want chicken rice and honestly, right, when when you come up with anything, I realized that when I went in to family, gatherings or so nervous because of the questions they would on, what are you doing now? And that was the question. I was actually kind of afraid of when I was younger, cuz I always be like modeling but then I need like, if I was still schooling and I still am, I know. It's like I have a backing that will get me support. That's why I always felt like I needed a supportive like background on Call of Duty cuz they'll be more interested in that, you know, cuz I felt like if I did"
"Or like they, they would understand that. It's something that is fun that I like to do. But of course, with my mom, they will understand that. But still, I felt like, is that not a right when we get closer? I Guess That's What I Call Music for on Monday. There's one thing that you wanted us to be. I think it's to get a degree and get away with it. Now, whatever age you are is to try things that you want to do boxing. I didn't take Wonder all those funny. We were things, I wanted to do like cuz I wanted to be like, hey I can defend you eat sushi."
"Okay, if you don't like it, I don't like you. But if it were entirely up to you, would you pursue a degree? We have to care about anyone's expectations because I mean honestly psychology has been something. I've been very interested in studying and learning new things, And then I was thinking with everything that I've tried out in my life that were hobbies that were trial-and-error, things. I realize that mess calm was something. I felt I could do like even without Dennis, Rodman business."
"I didn't know I was going to do a business. You know, I'm just going to use my street-smart better than you know what I mean and then psychology. Wow, you don't know anything about it. You can apply to your daily life. Talk to your friends all the time. They come to you about problems. You can help them do it. Wasn't it wouldn't have been my first decision cuz I would have just been like, yeah, but then my dad was like, you still studying and yes, I am very nice. But you do a lot of families, I guess where the children are expected to go into a certain field right. Now. I feel like that's more for the parents happiness than for the child have their kids also so that the parents know that the, the kids will be. Okay, if anything would have happened. I think it supposed to know that, okay. My child has a good stable job is studying a"
"Field that can support like his or her entire life, you know, I think that's why parents. Maybe it's like the Asian cultural so that that's like okay. I need you to be in a stable family so you can raise your kids. So you don't have to worry about whatever they thought they had to worry about when they were younger and strew in Celsius questions. If I am gone the next day and my child of himself to be able to do something like. Yeah. Yeah, so I guess, you know, sometimes we do things to make them feel most secure more comfortable. And also I think if we do want to try new things, we have to show them that like, hey, I'm serious about this."
"Hey, I can do it hate, other people are doing it, and they support me, you know, and I think they like with me also coming into the music industry. I I kind of hate it for my family for a little bit because I also want to take a nap like, wrap it up nicely and gets them in a box. And this is it not doing this. How do you mount a bed for a while? But you've been to you when she saw that, he actually she's doing. Okay. And then she started it. Yeah, so I agree with man that, you know, like you have to be serious like that. This is viable like, oh, you can do this, you know, and I also think they get a bit more scared as you get older, because maybe when you're young, does I okay? That you can try this. You can try that again. You can change. If you want to, you know, you do."
"How to do this anymore, but then I just left yet whether they probably get a bit more serious because they're like, okay, you need to choose the school. Now, you need to choose at this and that and I was the, the kid in the school that kind of like didn't know what I wanted to do. What you know, everybody after like 11 with a p. S l u w. What score did you get? I was like, I passed so I'm flying. So maybe the system about ranking, even express. It probably affects a lot of children is now and even like the college and Paulie and I T E, everybody like says, go to ite programs and things like that. So, sometimes I'm like, why, why have the comparison when everybody's just trying to do that best, you know, everybody's not the same. Exactly ask you this, okay? If you could"
"She was right. Would you choose being book smart or street? Smart, smart Street, you want to see books about if you did, then you don't have to study that you just come to you naturally, right? And if you remember and your own way then you but I don't know. This is kind of the thing I think about like the book smarts as a sweet smell kind of thing. You can be book smart, but can you apply it? Maybe you can innovate yourself? You can kind of like become a comedian in your environment. But some people who are maybe book smart or like even like some of my friends, they don't know how to apply it cuz I think even the schools teach so much that you must do math this year. As write your English, this way, I'm dyslexic so"
"I knew the answer, but my workings would come to be a bit different. Okay, and they wouldn't, they would say I'm on. This is wrong, but I don't like that cuz I was like, Mike on everybody. If you get the same result, we can do it and you can apply it to life goals. Of Parental expectations right on YouTube. Very good grade exam, papers 95 for example, and your prayers go in 5 lb life."
"Whatever you want. As long as you pass and you tried your best, I mean your kids are very lucky but a lot of depression and anxiety because of all this pressure from their parents to be who their parents when they"
"I mean, living in Singapore is not easy. Cuz you know, I feel like this. So everybody's turn up one each other and not maybe not just a but just the whole social environment right now, especially with social media. Everybody's going to Oshi did this. Okay. I must do a better or, or he got better grades. Okay. I must try and meet meet that, you know, and I don't like it. But what can you write a note on social media? People only show you what they want you to see the best parts. What's happening in somebody slide? All you see is a nice picture, you know, but nobody has problems with things that thing but as someone studying psychology, the rates of mental illness is not just Singapore about. We do learn a bit of like stats feeling the US and in the UK. And I got all that kind of things. And I don't exactly know the number, but I know there,"
"An increase is like compared to how things were before before, like social media, especially in before, like so much comparison. It's definitely increase. And I'm actually writing my dissertation, which is, in 10,000 words on the association of social media, with social comparison, active and passive, social media, usage and happiness levels, and we found that those passive social media users. So act like he posed you, and you post pictures and all that but passive means you just scrolling you're looking and we found that those who scroll more and not passive users actually have a higher, Social comparison and higher levels. I mean, and lower levels of happiness."
"Because I guess they're not confident enough about themselves to post active self esteem of the cells to post. And like, I think also, when you're posting and you so active, you don't try to care about other guys, or are you trying to look at yourself? You were looking through so many different bodies and faces and people doing different things where you should come. I always busy cuz I had a hypothesis where you're like, okay, if you're more active, that means you, you're more likely to social compare yourself, you know, and people just think that I owe you so active. But the passive ones, the ones that are hiding actually might be more anxious very much for hello."
Interesting statistic that me and my psychology teacher that just goes to show that you don't know what's happening on the unhappiness right off. All your friends stories that you have them where they follow their parents choices for them in life and they were upset about it.
"Do your friends like that? I don't think I had a story but I I I probably heard somewhere maybe from a friend but I can't remember like an exact thing. Okay, but it's yeah, they follow in their pants with that they want. Or can I take over the family business, and become a doctor and all that kind of thing? And then they're not happy. They drop out they stop and then go Bolsa de then they become lost. Okay, and then after that they try and go into whatever they want to and then it works. I think I'm happy. You finally have a purpose of doing something. Instead of all, I got to go to work again, just because I like to see it. And I wish more people would set of think about, you know, which is obviously especially in Singapore, every parent wants the kids Excel academically and we know that studies are important, you know, but I wish that they were"
"Realize that giving your child skill is so important as well, because that is setting them up for the future as well. Excel in school. Right? You just have to do well and you'll be fine because of your life. Exactly, exactly. But there's so many people that we see around us who get skills are feeding them. Now actually, did you know that kids from the age of three to six, the brain actually developed a lot of parents actually, choose to send a kid to a Richmond classes, a music classes, whatever, you know, because from do things, right? The brain develop faster. So when the independent school depends, can she likes because whatever that they can do for the kids they have already done. So that's why."
"Schools make a child, learn more stuff than being like this. I guess, I guess he's awful parents who don't really want to force the kids too much yet. But from a young age as parents. They should make the right to them. They should be making the right choice or that keeps by sending them to Richmond classes. So it opens up the kids options in future. It's true and I think when your child gets to a certain age to buy letting them decide what they want to pursue your helping them think for themselves like hazel sit if the next day the pain is gone and all the child knows is what the parent ones who was going to try and meet them you lost to but sometimes I guess also medal in not just Korea, but relationship, what you wearing."
"Okay, let's not named her cake. She's a good friend of mine. When she was in uni. She brought her my friend brought her boyfriend home right now to meet the parents. And then I remember she told me her mom author. Why is this guy only our second Apple for the mom was asking her? Why is he not first class honours? The way she dresses? I think her mom with all the things I you. What is, are you going to do?"
"And my friend will be so effect that you should be happy. Bobby go, but whenever it comes to outfits, you always, send me a babe. You think this is too much. I just don't like I know who will represent and go out and change into what it was you wanted person, but she chose to take engineering."
"I don't know what she's doing a job in engineering. Now. She's happy. I'm not sure if she's the happiest. I mean, she's performing well as she can excel in that whatever she does, but I really do think she'll be better off. Writing scripts writing novels acting and Shoals. I just think of all the wasted potential in people that chose that, right? That they should, we cannot fault. Her mother was a bit harsh but her intentions are always the best for the doctor. I mean, I don't know if this happens but I feel like I like when you listen to your parents, when especially, when you don't know what to do when you lost, you know, when you listen to your parents and then maybe you finally doing something you will start to appreciate, like, oh I see. Thank my mom for letting me like push me and choose for me to do this because now I finally know what I want. I need to do, you know, I think some kids right now also a bit lost."
"I think that's what's up. When you need to kind of like, give them like different seeds basically, to see which one they want to plant. Wow. That's a great metaphor."
"Mine 2021 faced struggles. When you were choosing this career that you wanted to do and your parents you I'm kind of tried to stop you or will not support this know. I was very sure of what I wanted to do. Personally for me. Some of that has never once since I was born up until maybe two years ago. Did he ever say, I want you in the family business? So to me, it's like I'm free to do. What if I wonder, how am I expected? Because my brother, my older brother, traditionally thought I was going to be the business that is. And he said it was only very recently that. She, she actually told me like Barbie Barbie."
Barbie. He would prefer that I was in the family business then working in the entertainment industry. And how do you feel?
"Dad loved because I actually told him I said that, you never told me this one's going up. If you had told me, I would have gone to business. I would have prepared myself. At one point. I was like, what should I really do? And if I had known this, I would have gone to business. I'm not interested in something way more fun to do you still? But now I know that there's this expectation, right? And it kind of changes like it changes how I perceive my future complete me, but then I also think that now and you should doing something that you love and that you enjoy and I feel like studies and you know, whatever you want to try out like, you know, you want to get a diploma and all that kind of thing studies can always come whenever wherever if you don't have the physical strength to be in sports your entire life, you know, that something and so do that"
"Will always be there. No matter what age you are, no matter where you are. So I can imagine if now he's like, you're doing your your hoes things and radio, DJ, they find it so fun and maybe one day you get like a bit. I want to say tired, but you just like I feel like maybe getting into the family business. Then you can slowly start studying and get into it whenever you want. You know, whenever you're ready and I will already know what it is. Would you let go of your DJ job? Honestly. I don't know what they're going to do. Sorry. If I"
"So we don't know where I left then take us to. Do you love you guys at your parents, you know support you wholeheartedly visiting my parents don't it's just that I feel like no matter what behind every parent I mean behind every parent like thinking there will always be some sort of expectation. Imagine if you had a baby and then I mean they grow up and they do something and then you'll be able to let me, let me I want to be a ticktocker. What would you say to your hypothetical child?"
"I will let him know cuz I didn't know if people would do it or not. We created. Dictate what? I told you her attack. Okay, that you don't exactly when you're climbing the tree. Yeah, and I went to like the staircase."
"Are you okay or not? Because I feel like sometimes parents didn't know that. It's a mistake, right? And do you want to jump in right away and save you? But I think sometimes some mistakes. You just have to make yourself ever experienced some Hot Chip, some heartbreak. And that makes them the facility. I don't know. Maybe it's just the Asian culture and I feel like it is because I personally feel, but sometimes when I go through things, it's also a bit harder to talk to my parents about it. One hundred percent. I don't tell my parents about my troubles. That? Yeah, if I think about it, like, I don't do those. Sometimes like maybe my mom. Like you look so gloomy today, but it's the way I woke up."
Impression of a mother of a mother.
"You know what? I mean? Like to communicate with them. I told me, the reason why he doesn't know how to communicate is because he grew up in a family of 12 children and his parents never had time to communicate so well for themselves and because of that, dude ain't like that. When I look at my boyfriend's family, he talks to his mom about like problems or Singapore or like and then when he's like, when he we met in like, you know, like started like dating you let you mount. Can you show a bit more emotion? So it's hard for me to show it more because it's not something that we receive on a daily discuss today. Write about"
"Expectations, let's see. We've got listen to right now and they're going through that with their parents. Want them to be a certain person going to a certain line. What would you want to tell that? That isn't what you want to do?"
"Okay. No, okay, honestly, have studies as a backup because I am actually quite grateful that I have a back-up plan and that has always been something that I felt like I needed. Also because you say, 50 if I really cannot do this and I tried it and it doesn't work out, at least, I have a back-up plan. I feel like studies or, you know, just a little bit of Education that, you know, you enjoy also like, don't go into engineering if you don't want to get into business or psychology or whatever it is. Mascom, but going to something that you want to also figure out and try out different things that you want to do. Cuz when I was going into music with Don, so being an athlete, I was also like, who should I do this or not? But it was in me. It was in my mind all the time. So I just took that risk going to do it because I was like if I'm young I mean older I don't think I'm going to have the time to look back and be like damn like I should have done that. So don't regret it."
"Just do what you want to do. Especially when you're very young right now to those kids that are even if you're not just do whatever you want to do to take hotline. Definitely. You must strike a balance between your own interest and your parents. So I'm going to say if your parents do you want to go for a degree? I think you can consider that actually do something that you like something that you like. And I think I have that degree. You said he's good pursue what you want for yourself. I think this is like clashing with the time. You must also know how you're going to manage your time. You know, you, you must be ready to be like, hey, this thinks my class, with my studies. So, in between find timer after this, I got to do some school assignment when you know what I mean. It's a discipline."
"I thought you was Errol. What's your advice? But for me, right? And I feel like, you know, sometimes you think like friends don't understand me. Like, why did making me do this and that, but we also know now that we're older, but, you know, it's always a good face that, you know, what they had us. They didn't have a manual day. They had to try and everything out the first time as well. So I want to send email to huh? Every time I let me tell you this."
"Naughty child very strong, hate everything. Because, okay, you know, when you were in school, right out of your teacher, with Austin, to get your parents signature right now, if I didn't do very well, which also means 19. Okay. I can't even get 1987."
"Okay, so if I go to tell you and then fight about it and still get in at the time and I didn't meet the scoring. So I don't know if any of your parents have a say this but don't say I don't want to sign on the side to make it back to school and bring it back to school and my mother is not happy. And hence. She doesn't want to sign. Okay for that. She had to sign do the mark, the mark the month and I realize that she's not making any sense."
"So I told her I thought about this aside, right? She's making noise about here and I have refused to bring it back to school and finds. All right, so I thought about this but nobody say that you signed to say that you're happy. You find the show that you seen it. Wow. That is the reason of easy listening, right? If you bring home your Moxie of parents and do not happy and I don't want to sign. Tell them that it's a, it's not like it, you don't have to be happy."
Reasonably.
"An example of time ahead. If you really want to do something, especially if it's something that you may have to prove yourself. Or I think you need to prepare yourself as well. And I think you need to have a solid plan, you know, if you present and so do you come from a place where they know that you have a plan? You know what you're doing, you've done your research, for example, you know, the Avenues that you're supposed to go to the steps. I think you'll be a little bit more short. Maybe they might still be hostage until they see some results, but I think at least that's something, you know, it's not just, like decided to stay with me. But what actually are you going to do about it? You kind of explaining the plan for me to like, when I want to travel, as I poke. When am I going to book my ticket? Where am I staying at? Who am I going with you?"
"That was one time. I was supposed to fly and then she kind of got a little bit upset because he was like, what you going alone for this work, very like I was like, well, it's a work trip. I have to go then but then he was like, okay fine, but you need to bring somebody now then I was like, okay then I called and then we got someone with me but usually I would like kind of like lay it all there. Like I feel like it's easy to talk to my mom and then I'll be like, maybe I live in South Africa, I can stay with Grandma. Like I'll only be there for ten days. You know, I'm not going to go anywhere. We have friends over there is no, that's okay. When are you going on with nobody? Have you booked it yet. I looked at it. Caught. OK, Google flight."
"If I tell my mom that right after that, that the depression, if I am not right in the head so they all think of him a sudden way, but going out with him. And you know what, people think of him. Basically, is he that way at home as well? Like you know, who is this like football that they don't know about, you know, how maybe he is at home with his kit for a xylophone. But Gordon Ramsay, what are you? An idiot sandwich, but then I mean, okay."
"When do I get quite serious? But then he's the type that site, was that off when I have like grapes, like that kind and then she'll sing for fun in the house. Then he jokes around so much like sometimes, he'll he'll just, like, make a little jerk. Can I use Skype like a little child at home? I don't talk to you. Like, I mean, like if you work with him, I guess. So he's very different and I feel like everybody's kind of like that. So, you know what? I mean? Like when you when you closer with your friends or family, you're in a different way from people, you just me."
Where can we watch? This is on TV. I was so intimidated. I call him. So I think he was very nervous because actually it's like with this industry. I think he's not very I wouldn't say comfortable. I think he's more cuz it's not in his area. Is your second warning?
"But like when you meet somebody, he always needs like somebody next to him everything because I think he's, he's at that person that likes to be around people that he knows. So actually, that day, I felt like he was coming over especially when we were in The Green Room. When people started talking to him, like, Hey, this is just, it's, it's, it's, it's I do this, is it for a month, then you said, okay, nice to meet you. Then that's probably when he felt more comfortable talking to you about his lucky. Now, you know, we are lucky to be able to, at least communicate with her parents. So, advise you have all this in, this was struggling between parents and their own. I think, as you grow up, you will realize that your parents are far from perfect. They have their own flaws. They may be strong, hit in their own way, as well. And the thing is, I feel like at the end of the day, right? It's about you."
"Getting over what people? What people's opinions of you are people, you know, kind of like judge you about something. No matter what age you are. I will be very hard thing to just kind of like push it away, but people don't think about you as much as you think. They know what's it called? B, like you mustn't think? So, highly of yourself where you think old people thinking about me, but that's where the world revolves about, who cares. I generally just try to like ignore whatever people like make judgment about what I'm doing and stuff like that. You know what you see in four rooms don't have a Google, Ok, Google, it is kind of hectic."
"Hey, do you know? I don't do it and I think we've gotten like, really, really good ones who reminds day. And I think he knows if you want, there's like one of those 20 and she is. So why is Noah so much. But I also feel like this is because her parents gave her the chance to choose what she wanted to do. And I think for a lot of them, you know, you think that by helicopter going around them right that you're doing them a favor, but I think when you give them that little room to choose what they want to do to make choices for themselves and to be responsible for their own actions, I think this is what you got to get. Someone is able to see the world little bit wider."
"I feel like, I mean, that explains like a lot of things to do and I feel like when you go through different things, I also realized I had become more independent, more confident. I used to be super shy. I would never talk cuz I might but not with like learning about the new industry and wanting to do different thing. I learned more about myself that like, hey, you know what, stay with me. So I can both in line have more confidence in yourself and the choices that you make of consoles, will come and get your parents. And I hope that this episode about how you can quit making decisions for yourself with that. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for having me to be 19.

You know, that's the thing that like really helps us work together and brings out the best in each other and we fight. Well, I've been in relationships before him a few.

"$6,430. Not as much money as last year. New message. Read. This is a topic that we are going to be unpacking today, money. We are going to talk about another topic related to finance, but mostly about Alchemist what a success really mean to ask. Because I know some people chase after monetary success, but some people see prices of recognition. Xbox says, okay start wars, Maybe."
We are all so proud of her because our radio show has been nominated.
"It is beyond me. So low shoulder the rest of the prescriptions. Very, correct."
"Prices of recognition of what metals promotions and other people see success as a journey into you. Wow, you're mean, when I think of success. I actually think of my dad because he, he successful in his own, right? And he came from nothing. He came from a family, with 14 children, struggling struggling to make money, and he came from richly wrecks to riches. So I always think success is going to meet you. How, how, how old is a little bit? Maybe it's not as popular, and not answer. And I think maybe people will be like, chewing on C sleep and leaving it. I will tell you that. I just want to be happy."
Because I don't need a lot of images of ostriches flash by my hitting 10 out of 10 times. I She's Mine.
"Luxury goods, worry. That means you are successful. If you can on this fax, I thought that is one form of success. Monetary success has years as well as well. Why don't you think? I don't see it. As I holla, if you like it you can afford it and you want to buy it. Sure, you know, but I don't think anybody who lets a doesn't have, it should look at it and feel like, oh, I'm less only until I have that than unsuccessful. Yeah. So I feel like there's something wrong with it. I mean, I cannot send it because I love you too. Right? But my principal, when it comes to luxury goods is that, I don't think you should be starving for it."
"Absolutely not. I should be spared change. Yes. It should be within your means. Exactly. Exactly. I don't think you should be like, putting a sight more than half of the right. You know, I don't think like that. If you do that, that's your choice. That's okay. As long as you're not like, in debt, but I do think that it's not, I don't, I don't I material Goods to success. Although I know it's a form of you know, it's like a bunch of other people, right? Looking back like that is you don't people. Look at you different. I know you must be a $15,000 bag, right? I have a book."
"I feel like it anyway, I mean, we all know that you come from a very well-to-do family. Do you think luxury back some time to regroup mean that you are successful before she sees anything. I just want to see you at. I thought about this for a while and breast with all her friends were a couple weeks ago. When she said, I don't think this was on it, but I remember we had a conversation about you. No coming from a comfortable bike route and something to means it's stuck out to me, which was but it's not my money. It's demanding and I felt right? Like, 1 because I have tons of his friends, right? And"
"It's very rare that you hear something like that and to be able to deficient what you and that means a lot to me, what I bought my first luxury bag. It was a Chanel boy, which I brought today."
"You know how much this means to me? I even remember the date. I got it. Oh my gosh. What is MBS all Chanel, and it's different. You know what? To write to our Instagram. Very nice. I remember $1,430 for this Chanel, boy. I think know I'll be asking small. Honestly. I feel like, what a lot of people, you know, they want to be happy. But I think in that Pursuit of Happiness, right? It takes a lot of Courage. It takes a lot of courage to see this is,"
"I'm looking out for me. I'm done. Okay, because a lot of people don't have that courage to cut out things that I'm not looking out for them. Either you feel responsible for it? Or they feel like they have no way out of it. I feel like they can't do better than it is. I think it's important that, you know, it is well, that sucks as comes in like a variety of forms and whatever it may be for you. Right? I hope you don't let people in fluency choices because if that's your truth, that's your truth is. That's what you want. That's what you want. If it keeps you, happy that keeps you happy, but I think a lot of us still thought of taking the consideration what people will think, you know, we forgot to like luxury goods, maybe some people do it because they feel like oh and makes them look successful. No point. I mean, there's no point. If you carry, it doesn't all the while that but you have nothing in sight, right?"
Small pizza. I saw a picture of his ex. I went hysterical and he woke up. He was like
"Hi, I'm Hazel Highway 80 and I'm to be welcomed by the cleverly's."

"I'm going to be very honest with you guys at, and it's not something that I'm proud of him. And, you know, when I was young, I was in the two, I think insecurity played. Well, all right when it came to relationships, so this boyfriend, I'm with now, right? Yeah, I was with him when I was much younger. He was my first boyfriend and I didn't really know how to do with like jealousy and I wasn't that confident in myself because I became very controlling. I demanded to know where he was all the time. If he tells me that he's leaving and 15 minutes late. He's 15 minutes, 15 minutes, things like that. It was really, it was really that crazy and and and"
"And yeah, I was known as a psycho. Girl. I no longer know last time they're using the Havana City. Yeah, he's supposed bro, and they're like that. Wasn't that rubber piece that sell outright dropped on the floor, and he didn't pick it up. He just walked away and I upset you. Please give me some."
"So this is not a sofoke, is another one of my ex's and help me about it in the morning when I wake up? Or what? If we are disconnected, I will cry."
"Yeah, they're still out for work, right? This is so unprofessional, but we are on a call throughout the eight hours at work question. Just another friend, would you be okay?"
"Some of the feel like I'm not feeling about that because I don't like to tell my parents. What's going on with my work, especially if they are negative experiences because I don't want them to worry. Another thing is because I think my parents are very traditional. So anytime I tell them something. The first thing that would do is to find the problem in the prop in the, in the things. I tell them and the school me for it and my mom will always see. That's why. I said I take because she's leaving like longer longer than I ever have been, right."
"But yeah, when I realized that I'm taking things too far. Okay, we wouldn't depend on the holiday, right? I used to have this problem where I get right in my head about it. I need to check my partner's phone. If I don't write what if I make up in my head is worse than what I asked me. What c o okay. I don't trust him. Isn't that? I think he's going to do something. It's just in the Hotel. This was like maybe 7 a.m. And I decided okay. I'm just going to keep the single thing."
On his Explorer phaser. I saw a picture of his ex exploitation means he doesn't follow. It. Just popped up on the algorithm ugly crying. I went hysterical and he woke up. You say
"And after that whole debacle, I realize shit. I really went too far. I need to work on myself. I have done. This is why I never try to let you know that he was talking to one of his female colleague. Okay, and the content that they talked about really make me realize how much she's not telling me. I mean in terms of would like these things that you tell you if you will call it. I would have loved to know as a girlfriend."
"What you said about that beer and he said, I'm still not used to hearing y'all soon Chinese and actually, spoke Mandarin with me. It's not about the people in the relationship. Realizing that, hey, this is obsessive. Perhaps it takes someone else a family member or friend, or even a neighbor. If you hear that your neighbor right, going crazy hitting each other. Maybe you should also consider calling the hotline time comes for you to take action. We should be the one doing it. Okay, so is girls you hear what sounds like beating and adults and children crying from your neighbors."
"What should you do? If, Halo 800-777-0000? That's right. And it was friend tells you about abuse that they receive from the husband, or the wife. What do you call a female at? His? Violence is never the answer."
"Clarity's. Across a stranger, is a series where strangers with similar experiences come together to discuss the problems within the social landscape and underlines dick must this video is a recap of the five different episodes featuring. Various individuals each with a story that did not make the final cut on YouTube. I have contemplated and I have attempted suicide, many times. Since I was 17. The last time I tried was in November last year, when I ended up in the hospital. I was hospitalized for five days with two days on the life-support. So it's seduces me a lot that the thought of the possibility of descending everything. So when I think about suicide and you know, a lot of things come to my mind, first of all, I have an alter who is severely depressed alter who's always thinking about suicide and ourselves home. So the struggle"
"I have with that part comes to mind. It also reminds me of my attempt last year when it was an attempt by we were like when I say, we, I mean, like me in my office when we would like me to Make It or Break It thing. So if we die with this, we die, but if we don't, then we're not going to try this ever again. Before we been trying for like more than 10 years now and nothing works. Well, maybe that's the reason why it's not working. Maybe I have something to offer to this world. So let's try to focus on that instead."
"My name is Gayatri and you can call me Gaia. I am the main host of my div system. A system is like me. And they all the other Alters that I have there is currently about 50 plus altars in my system. They can come and go. As in like I can get more Altus or the number can reduce depending on the purpose of the altar. So if an author's purpose is served, the order can disappear sometimes, not in every case. It is very different from for everyone, with d, i d not know to the it systems are exactly the same."
"My child pots are named Ito, Wawa. Nalina. Nano. Panda. Panda has also called Pikachu because she is wearing a, a Pikachu onesie. So when she came, when she first introduce herself, she did know her name. And she just kept saying, Pikachu, and then later on, she realized who she is. So, it happens when there's no communication issues in the system. She realized her name is Panda. I have human Alters. I have known human Alters. I have shapeshifters. I have aged sliders. That means they don't have a definite age. They can slide from a certain age to a certain age. I have also switched, don't have ages. I have a fairy. I have a, a dragon. I have male and female parts, but mostly females. And they're also things called subsystems, which means my alter has"
"So, it's very complicated."
"Hello, I'm Hazel Eye, Missouri and remain, welcome back to clarity."
"We're back. We have a whole new set. We are addressed in a whole new. But yeah, yeah, we're like the conversations that we're going to be having with you intimate, that we mentioned in season one. So sensitive talking about female Breadwinners Salvador."
"She's been for you next week. So, we're talking about women who actually the primary, or soreness in their household, just not as much as they're bringing home. Maybe they're not the sole they can be the sole or maybe, you know, they are just adding more than that, Pat's, bringing the income for a family of two reasons that this takes. I don't know if you know this, but female Breadwinners that actually more commonplace than people think. Yes, so we've got a research write-up about working mothers. In Europe of them are actually the main Breadwinner in the family is 33% of women in heterosexual relationships or marriages."
"War in Singapore, right? What would the percentage be like?"
"Maybe close to a quarter or third me to maybe twenty to thirty percent. Do you know of any female Breadwinners in your social group, your family's relatives. I mean, Chinese New Year's coming, right? So maybe we can let a situation where like the father is a stay at home. And then the mother is the sole Breadwinner died. In all honesty and I don't have a friend like that walks a stable job. So she holds down a stable job so he can carry on to do what he wants to do. And then he's also the one who shuffles the kids every day does all the stuff with the kids every day and so is she happy in the relationship?"
"Are you okay with your husband? A stay-at-home wife is really sensitive. Like for me. I don't think I can ever be that figure for the family, just because I think it makes me emotionally a bit more insecure. Like, I wouldn't want to be dependent on for the entire family. Say if I have like a few kids in the future, and my husband is not working. Everyone is depending on me. I think that is very, very stressful. I mean,"
"You know, anyone in my life that is the sole Breadwinner or even the kind of like main Breadwinner will allow women in the last couple of years. It is like in even like with celebrities you see a lot more than the females anymore. Is it Beyonce and Jay-Z small? My niece visiting speaker husband doesn't make her feel like she needs to provide for the family that can I be a child."
"But yes, we started to shift, but still write the attitude to what's a female? Bring the right way. It's kind of like a b negative. I would see in our society. What do you think? He's definitely more stressful for the guy. I mean, as a lady, I feel stressed at our entire family is dependent on me. But how would the guy for you? Emotionally seems to be Breadwinners of families, write a t in the middle fingers in the way. You're supposed to, be bringing income doing the most for your family. While your wife stays at home to look after the kids. I think these are very traditional conceptions, people have a family's. So is this is Rose a verse of stress from friends and family brother. This is like the den to what color are basically if you want more than that."
"Your job as a guy, or a man or male figure in the household is to provide for the family and to know that someone else is doing that job. And then I said your wife. I think it might be okay, but what do you guys feel like on women earning more than men? Couldn't you? Okay. Yes. Okay. Up. The middle finger is not working hard enough. Maybe maybe the female is just extra hot working in a different should men always on more than they're in a wives of hotness."
"No, no."
Noah.
"Get the question right? Light should men always I'm up because some people actually think that some men are raised to believe that they have to be the breadwinner to have to bring you. Don't bring the bread home about the whole family and it's wrong for the woman to earn more than him. I feel like we've communicated properly. This would not be an issue at all. I have one friend. She's a tuition teacher. So she is very hot looking. She doesn't look as how she expanded the business. And as a result. She's only a lot more than her husband. Then boyfriend or husband. She's the one purchasing a car for the family. She used to ride a motorbike when she didn't have money to buy a car. So now that you go to car to pass on, this will go back to her husband, okay?"
Family Feud your relationship with soufflerie. Sure. You guys would date a man who I'm blessing you.
"31. Yes, you're hesitating because it's part of this is dependent on his mindset, his attitude, but he's lazy and twice as fast. And it'll just improving himself in different ways. Not just in terms of like bring the money back home. I think that's okay with date. A man who aren't letting them more than them. You see all the cost of living in Singapore is so high. I don't give me consult this women for thinking that, okay."
"Okay, let's see if he's okay about 3000 versus 1,000. That's like every dollar Collins. You know what I mean by talking about 25 verses 35 - 30, okay."
"But yeah, I still do think that like, honestly in Singapore because the cost of living is so high right now, two incomes and less like one of them really, really a filthy amount of money, but most of the time you need to have income. So that question, right? Actually least with this, can women be the main and only Breadwinner in the family in Singapore, Singapore enough. Okay, if you are okay with it if your partner is okay with it, it's like a mutual thing a while ago and I think it was it was about someone else lot. But basically about how, you know, like what she be, okay, being the one who earns more and I think he mentioned that usually let people think about the guy like the guy be okay with his, he going out and stuff like that. I think at some point he said, actually, I think you need to consider whether the gold, be okay with it right now because I always about the guy,"
"Exactly. I think people usually forget, because you've always at all milk Eagle, all they think that should be bringing the tool holder, something that you don't know. But, I think sometimes when girls say like, oh the independent and, you know, they made money and they're okay with a guy not making, as much as them excetera, but I think the question is, are you really okay with it? Because of a part of you feels like you want to be provided for you want to be, you know, a Ty Ty? Yeah. Some sort of like, you know, I wouldn't see control. That's about what but music Security in. You do an environment where there are no female Breadwinners around you, you would be conditioned to believe that it, you know, I shouldn't have to be the high in fact, you know."
"Can be the meaning Gilbert when it's in a lot of single-parent families. That is a key to know. It's about the addition of the guy. If a guy is President, that's why they are like the old one out. We have to consider their feelings if women can be sober living, but the guy must be okay. Of it or they must both be okay with it, you know, if I believe we're both, my parents were very hot. So I don't have to be the sole Breadwinner for the family means that I have to choose my partner wisely. Someone I can live with long-term for the rest of my life and we can see eye-to-eye in many aspects, especially in, now that you've mentioned that right."
"Okay, come and do this today. I felt like. It, you know, like how come this is something that we have to debate, we have to debate because I don't want my love for you is good for you. Okay, what am I single mother? And so like my entire life. I just watched a like provide for me you and she just walks heart beats me to the best of our abilities. You Raise Me Up on ya."
"I think maybe that's why I like I never thought of like yeah, you know, it's very possible because you never thought that is not commonly seen usually do female Angeles. Okay. So now it comes to this, lady's adding more than your partners."
"Okay, if you have any tree do on this again, 21, yes. Okay, why? Maybe? Because I'm flexible get more gigs. And let me know. We have like a fixed salary of this Leaf radio, but we have other sources of income, right? Yeah. Thanks everybody. Everybody make it depends, which means that if it's a good month for me, somebody else. Maybe half that I make more than him."
"What about you? What do you feel about adding more than your partner feel? Like I mentioned just now mine, that is very important. My boyfriend has his own production company, and it's only been running for about 4 or 5 years. So, you know, yes, when the company just stopped. It had no income needs. And then like the 3 owners, don't take any money themselves, and the companies that put options and I'm very happy for them. But my career has also taken flight line, 3 to 4 years. So I think in terms of the stable income, mine is more stable. And I've mentioned that engagement engagement. They bring an extra income for people like a radio dogs. Artistic kisses, you know, comes from many different streams. So yeah, I believe I'm going."
"Pitbull that came but it looked as if they that he's saving more than me. Okay, cuz I don't know how"
"Do guys do it every other day? She wants a new back, Mom."
"So I called her out of a kind of emasculated, make them less of a man. No, not at all because he is able to provide me a listening ear. When a neat. And I think that's the most important thing to have in the boyfriend question about, right? And when do it, like stopping at this, for months, that, that mean that you had to cover, you know, like his meals, you mean, did you have to make up for that like months? Let you know, provide for him for that, couple of months, thankfully? No because he has his own amount of savings back from that. He's an sd850. Like, Pete has dropped the gigs that he's company of Gothic days like this. He's able to, you know, we have a bit of savings."
"Yeah, I think personally, he might also a businessman selling cars, right? I think he's always been very ambitious. He's always wanted to start like his own business and stuff like that. And I was there with him from the start. It's been about 3 years now instead of his business pages and all that is already a big surprise to me. I'm more than him because he is a business owner and it's very, very difficult for them to. You don't make a lot of money in the first few years. I just breaking even trying to flip a profit, but I don't think that it like, emasculate him. Lol. I mean to him, he has it before to me that he grew up with his parents and that, okay. The mail has to be the breadwinner. The mail has two additional correct, but I think he is."
"I am even motivate him. You never know. He definitely wants to provide for me, but he does not feel less of a man eating less than me. And that could very well. She's in a couple of years. You see, right by the way, it is fine. But that means you ask him if he Minds that you are more than him."
Let me get a feature.
"Stress is a good thing. If you are not more than me, but I feel like that the more important thing here is that the guy should minimally have a decent salary so that I can provide a comfortable level of living for him and his family. If he does not then should be stressed. I'm happy to hear that because I assume for the way that he grew up right that he would think men have to unmoor. Yeah, but he thinks that the men must at least enough to provide a comfortable if you really doesn't anything in like you go see if he's lazy no ambition than to say that it's a worry like that. I cannot be with a guy with no ambition."
"So, what Jordan say it was similar to a surface 3 with no proud of you?"
"Yeah, but I'm very happy to hear him say this lot. And we can always write happy that you had some gigs or like, some posting them at this moment. I'm so proud of you. He will always be happy for me. But then when I told him that I'm recording a podcast based on this topic, right? Yeah. By Dickerson."
"What is a what about you? I wish you just put the three of them in the room together. And he said, no, I'll be proud of you. And he also said, I think how much money you make like money. Charity of has no has nothing to do with the value that you bring to the relationship."
"Wow. Yeah, I will see Mary but already done."
"What Hazel mention right about how what would Jordan like? He he's been happy for you when you get kids. I don't think that happens for every relationship is a relationship, right? When the men are doing so well successful. They're jealous insecurities insecure insecure."
"Nobody, is it possible. We will like this. I want to tell you to get out of it. But at the same time, I can understand why this guy is coming from the Asian. I do, you know the character the pier penguin, right? And he was very, very Michael. Michael Michael."
"Michael felt very insecure that Gemma was, you know, doing more kicks than him and wanted him so much so that she had to kind of like, right herself. Take a step back and not tell him how much seasoning is expensive. But I feel bad if I buy back, this is true."
"Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. This product in question. How much does it cost? Is it like a lesson hundred dollars? Kind of apparel or like a bad guy actually asked him if you should buy something that's worth thousands of dollars and they go by that by involving. This is so nice, you know if you don't right now."
I'm in the same room together.
"OK, Google"
"Do you ever wish your partners and more than you? Honestly, honestly, have you ever wasted like"
"Isaiah like whatever it is good for you, but I think beyond that Beyond. I feel like all the way a married right before me. Or like, at the end of the day. I feel like you're two holes, you know, we're coming together to complete each other because you should have already been complete complement each other. Yeah, you should already be on your responsibilities. For example."
"I don't think you have much involved. It doesn't send you as much as I think when I was younger. I, I might have wanted to be like in high tide American reading, right? But possibly know, right? I would, I would love to live if my partner makes more money to like buy things for me that says, I love it. When I come home, baby. I got a new bed for you. Like he wants to spoil me. Yeah, in the meantime, I spoil myself independent."
"Like what as well say, so if he is able to, I think that would be really good if we will decide that mean the future. I want to truly be worried. If they are not making any unemployed women feel ashamed, even guilty, when the unloading their partners, and some men, even feel very stressed out if it's okay. So, eat something yesterday as well. So, what he said, right? Was like, I think I'm he thinks that, you know, especially maybe in Asian culture where you said grow up knowing that or the men's Head of the family that the provider. So he thinks that, you know, maybe sometimes it feels like oh you need to like they need to do better. Like that's what he feels like. If he's"
"He is much to be, for example, and then he sort of sees it as my old. Okay, I need to do better, and I need to write this. Yeah, but he also feels that may be how people might perceive it. Is that because it's like an ingrained mentality. You see that they need to be a provider. So maybe she will know here that because like if you left or right, I have more things that he does because I'm a saver."
"But I was saved because he be so most of the stuff like, you know, like, I mean, most of the family stuff like that but yeah, it's nice. So obviously, I mean, with that in mind of the sea, I have liked more room to grow my savings. So I right. Yes. So he says like sometimes like for example, when we need to make like big, but you says and me to come off like cash, for example, and I'm the one, the cash that circumstances. Sometimes if you said, okay, it sucks. Oh, okay. Yeah. Why do you feel that way? Because I really should have been there by Pink constantly before you that every now and then even though even in the event that we need to come up with like cash. Either way, I would be the one. Yeah, and he feels like that sucks for him. But I mean,"
"Something that should be an issue because you're coming out the stuff like constantly. So that was like, oh, okay. Okay, but I was like, I have no issues with it. But yeah, I know it's just like a reminder for me that I should work harder parents and your partner. Would you feel ashamed? No, no, no. Okay. They wouldn't be like, you know, how can you eat something? If you stress running a list, all having that pressure on more than you"
"Never once has done ever sent this to me. I think we also mentioned earlier that we're just lucky nobody like, you have finals, to see it as motivation for themselves to what high instead. I would imagine that people out there who wouldn't want to be night. I don't know. Bring up on this down because they're not happy with his lunch. Actually survey. Last year, right? Open to dating women that earn more than them. So if you know, your man is actually very stressed about it, it really, he tells you like, you know, I feel like I should be any more than you like you should not be any money, then maybe you can go and shop around the house being sensitive about females and more than ever, right."
"Was married to this guy for a well in the Creator and she stays at home and lays around and offer lives of her. How can I go after this? I don't understand. You realize I walking. So is the man on small and the female bumps are on at home. Then, that's okay. Cuz of societal pressures. It also feels like it's completely. Okay. If the girl doesn't look like, he says that, you know, that if she doesn't want that, she sits a home that's fine. Nobody will say anything. So it's like so,"
I can quit.
"What would you do know? Because that's who you are and what you want to have your own achievements, and I know you feel more power and and"
"Do you know where? I know if like old married couple is right? That the father is the sole Breadwinner but the mother controls all the finances also. Yeah. Yeah, whatever the following to buy the mother will kind of like his mom will manage the financial. He was apparent. I really don't like it. That money last and you can you take messages."
Nola's breakup.
"Because the thing is, he has never never say something like this. To me. That one day that he ever says is, it means that he's a longer. The one that I fell in love with something."
"Whether it is, the man is a woman. I think we can all agree that being the breadwinner is pressure, considerations on the woman being the breadwinner. Okay? Okay, it can be exhausting for sure, for sure, because I guess we expect it to traditional. Yeah, do household chores. They have a children, be responsible for the child education and this into something that women who are more than their Partners will not have just one job. They have three sofa sleep. Do I need to actually look like a s e taking the Beagle of the house would cost. Ya start Lee managing their Partners easily damaged equal a woman's job to fix a broken, man."
"Baby. Who edits our charity, YouTube video, whatever we talked about, but yes, it is exhausting. No matter is the man of the woman who is the breadwinner but I I don't cook. I don't clean. Okay, let me tell you how I got my boyfriend, is the one cooking. So in that sense magic, you contribute to this relationship in different ways to measure, you help him with his business pages and things like that, and it'll be more details. So definitely need"
"Be angry, but it's even more exhausting, right? I guess is what other people think, holidays in Sweden."
He didn't want to say that. We don't care about what they think. Sometimes. It's a bit hard to voice is so like what is aresi about just know your friend right? Who the husband lives of her apparently female Breadwinners. Could sometimes spell a disaster and the relationship and lead to divorce divorce the song.
"I'm just wondering what that is. But I also think that break being a bright window, right? It's empowering things like, oh my God, wife or the female should be doing this, this this like all you should like your husband. You should like for it to be ready like when he gets home and things like that. I'll let you know, any sort of excitation like that. Like I might assist a homosexual, you know, for me, right? If you expect"
"The family unit to be working because you both on. Okay, and you are both contributing to your finances. Then why on Earth, would you say things like that? Because everything else be 50/50 as well as this would be a double standard, but let's look at the positive side of things. What is good about a woman being Breadwinner? I think it's like responsibility, the guy or the girl, right? Being the breadwinner is very stressful. Only income is very stressful and having a relationship. Exactly. And also like Financial advantages."
"I need my money. You want is my money. My money is on your mind, my income, not take a look at it and then off to see if he can. I treat myself with something, and then this is when you can go ahead and make it without having any other people to influence. This is what I'm getting. You know, what the hell you spend the money not ever Imaging, like having to go to the guy and saying, like, oh, I want to buy this so I can, I have I with my dad."
When I was younger and Henry School necklace.
The quiet.
"Oh my goodness. A good time. I think he's always had to go get a procedure at this point of time. She was not working yet and the boyfriend. Did you leave them? No money. No income, but he actually came to me to borrow money from the procedure. Yeah. It's not about the money either. So pay you back in full already know. A few years later, women always need to have your own savings because you never know. He's not rely on anyone else. One day. They might not be there anymore, for many many reasons. Are they still together?"
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, okay. Sometime ago. I had a listen to write in and I think it was around the time. I just got married. So he sent him a message. He looked at me and said, I know this is, like, not the most popular thing to say, but she basically told me not to have a joint account. Okay, and she told me her story, and she told me about how since the day she got married. So every month, when her husband gives them money, she keeps it in the joint account and over the period of like number of yes, she's a mess in amount and that's her, only say things. So she puts all her savings into the joint account. Okay, and then, one day, he just about everything and she"
And left of the kids and took all her savings.
"This heartbreak day. I'm sorry, but in the first place, I feel that as women. You should always keep a part of your income for yourself. Even if in a certain percentage percentages, I think maybe some women feel that my husband is going to be with me forever. We need a good part about being a female Breadwinners, is that take Allie to happy relationships? Actually says that relationship could be better when female on the big box."
"And then this research also believes that more than relationships where women out in their partner's, right? This is fundamentally positive because it indicates that women are in control of your choices. And I really like, I'm So This research essay is that women will have access to more partners and not just going to comply with the expectations of others. I think it's like a very attractive. Set My Friends up on a blind date. Rape and hang out. He actually said, you know, I find it really see that she is so successful and so independent. Like that's very sexy to me. Like they would be like Olden if you're so independent."
"Female Breadwinners, whether you see that employ you guys right to reflect on your own life. If you're listening right now and you're in a relationship is supposed to ask your partner. Would you feel stressed out? If next time you know, where we go out and work on more than you know, what is Diane Keaton related gum. If anything bad happens. It is the woman. And a man in a relationship ends the same amount of money, which part of Singapore. Do you think they'll be most likely to stay in random."
"Yeah, I know. I would have been a good one. Okay? Okay, so give up the Commonwealth."
Accurate accurate.
How to spell diseases?
All right. I just enemies episode.
I just want I just need all of it.
"Okay, Lal qila by the end of this episode. We must say that many women have mixed feelings about anymore. Their partners are being Breadwinners, but I feel that that's fully. Okay, as long as this is, keep it between you and your spouse and just know that it is not like an individual thing. It's not like a how come I'm feeling this way is a systemic thing. You were brought up like that is your environment. So, yep, and it's not an issue are you know, it's not kill black or white. So just really find something that works for you of your partner. And all right, people say that if it makes you happy, makes you happy. But I do agree that the culture in the world and buy me. We need in X. It's a bit hard for people to accept, but one day, I think how it will catch up and, you know, things will look better. Because, as long as the family has food, we should be grateful for the exactly.

"Really needed to hear it from somebody else. I know is I think, I, I, I was trying to figure out how to also deal with other people in my family being depressed because obviously, this isn't just taking a toll on you to get one of my family members, as well as therapy. Help me figure out how to better relationships with the people around me, who are not feeling so great as well. I think so, I've, I feel very overwhelmed sometimes often when I'm at home, a tree, which really sucks? Because I feel I worked very hard to like, do this space for myself, to sort of. I mean, who is a very safe space. But I think one sort of like work-from-home get didn't I didn't, I wasn't able to have a separation anymore. So I think doing something for you go. There were a lot of woman's but I just felt very, very overwhelmed by their responsibilities. I think, you know, when your mom and let you run your own business and let you have a whole night, suddenly. Everything is small priority than you."
"Self in your well-being because I need to make sure my kids have their meals. I need to make sure like, I always feel like I'm up to my neck, you know, with this setting. Should you never are always having to do something and never. I never like, there's no room for me to just be compressed. Like I mentioned before, I just feel like, you know, nothing about doing something like at the end of this. Like, when I'm taking my shower at night, I just involuntarily, find myself, like, crying they just from all, I guess they held up emotions from the D and like there's anything. So, even later having Zoom, sometimes, like back-to-back calls, and with my kids at home. Sometimes, you knocking. Is he trying to be like, over series HDR? It can be so much. But, like, I want to call"
"You need to finish this right now cuz it's not sort of this on the home setting that I wanted to create. But the truth of the matter is this is how you almost what we have to do is day today and it's Saturday. I expected to understand this even though that kids get it. But it's also I guess learning to just be like they had some grease in and be gentle about it with myself because you know, it's unrealistic for me to be hard on myself for something. I don't have control over because it's so muddled when you feel like you have no control over your home right now that is causing me to not have control over it. So I think that yeah that sort of the uncertainty of when is even going to end everything that I thought I had, you know in Czech."
"And if they just might. Pizza. So you like those days are the days that I just feel like I thought I had to get home but the podcast produce on the local, media publisher and grandfather. Sorry. This episode was made in collaboration with our friends and I'm they talked about on my hands and taking care of our digital cameras cheap Bots, Ash digital bonus episode."
"Immense respect for that parents doing that quit because I don't know how you are handling at home in like being like moms and night, helping your children grow up like an environment where they can all go to school by all means to be a kid in school right now. I'm sadder and more worried about. If I tell, what kind of trouble is this within her, and they are because I used to write notes in class. I wasn't he should be resting because of trying to match."
He says they getting shortchanged.
I've been to Blink Lacona like our usually actually breathing.
"Crazy hair, but it's what he feels is fine. He is comfortable doing and if you see if you doing, you don't pick up your mind and you do for a kid, I think sending me getting all this information and not knowing how to process it, like for re it like translated into this feeling that he couldn't describe and like once he found out was to you don't sort of meet school is fine again for him. And that was I taking him out like after school. Like going to the beach and it and it didn't mean like prioritizing all the time because I didn't say so then things that we do during that time after school. I usually go back to work, we would just have to stay late and we can do it right now because she has to spend time with him and just to reassure him and just to remind him that like things that he knew to be, you know, Steve and Lyfe still feel."
"Is it normal if we could take him out to the beach? If you could take him to the ground and he still felt like he could be a child, you know, and so I think as parents going through the Ventura meat like and it's not with me. I will go and sort of thing that we have to deal with, but also there about kids in and every kid react, if I need our daughters in order for them to still hang out with each other."

It is not the way that my parents about having these very simple conversation with like I'm keep having to do a mortgage be out in front of a divisor. Don't worry that they will have digital is real but I think I what we've tried to do is that we don't tell them that they cannot use the devices at all, but we try to talk to them about having a more healthy relationship with it. I did mention something about making real life more awesome for you."
"Schedule a meeting to keep cannot help but coming together and didn't want to be part of it except that he have. He has them a lot. But then they also need to know that, okay? That has to be in a lot of time. He's been a real, a real life. I think one good. I suppose manager would have been wiser if your phone disappear. And I like, what is it? You have to see for like, the life that you live. Right? Was it awesome or not, or do you spend all of a sudden your phone? That's why I'm so bored. I am boring you."

I think my activities like that, take them away from the device and it kind of like I'm not going to be creative imagination and those activities like these stories. They do not necessarily require you to always be overseeing, my time watching them. If you're going to be today is very busy bees, whatever you like Express themselves.

You need to ask him, if you can share it. You can just go ahead and pay which is what I realized. I guess we can filter out things that we where we didn't like what they take pictures of, you know that the internet is not necessary to please. That you can just behave, however, you want to do, you know that there is just like in real life in our rules are rules. I think about resetting, about you say great. What do you dry tonight?

I guess I have come up right up regarding digital boy now, and like, how we all need to stop for that thing. That space that we don't let me forget to self in real life on your phone.

"Toxic masculinity. Not only affects women but men themselves and society as a whole is real, but it takes an individual's changing. Real men need to be strong women, physically exhausting, but I think a lot of my opinion of men and how they should act didn't come for, my parents thought they came from TV, dramas Korean dramas movies 2 years ago. I watch Crash Landing on you."
"Oh, my goodness has helped me everybody, like the week, you hold the door open for the girls."
"By the way, it's like the fact that she got she doesn't just hold it off all the girl that he likes he holds the door for any stranger and he passes by me and I feel like if you offer to pay for meals is great, but it is of course how we expect men to key on a date in the wax, buy them to pay less than to hold of them to come and maybe pick us up in the car and they kind of being a toxic femininity. I think that is a patient's not discharged, its expectations of ideas and whether or not they can be translated into reality is an entirely different story altogether."
The girls might just Jordan three very well forget that. You just go to that door. Just leave me behind. You. Just open the door for me to call you all day.

It's not like I can you hold my cut. I was just like passing the car. Then I'll go do something with the intention of letting him be the one to get the car. But why would you do that?"
"I don't want him to always feel that, you know, I'm paying for stuff for you are even if you're passing the car. You are the one. I think I'm more selfish it because I wouldn't pass in my car. If I'm the one paying for the Butte Humane Society as a whole in this house. We actually cover toxic masculinity, but I realize that we actually gave love a viewpoint on what toxic trait can be just as I need to do exactly when you talk about toxic masculinity, right? You always must look at the flip side in any debate and that caused us to reflect on our self and realized."
But we also have some changing to do. Yeah.
In her. What is a sexy beast when something private featuring lesson on stories of women who have survived unspeakablegaming confirmed by 10 against all of this is a story.
This week's story comes from a listener who reached out to me. Wanting to share her story and you'll be single mother of one emotional abuse from her ex-husband.
"I am a single mom and I recently left my husband because he was emotionally abusive. I decided to leave for the sake of my own mental health. And for the sake of my son. I love you didn't see that. I see that I would be, it's a situation. We've been dating since, you know, we met in school and we've been together for so long. Can you match my entire adult life? And I feel like we kind of like go together as a couple as individuals."
But somewhere along the way things.
Felt like it changed. We are both very.
"Opinionated, we have are strong personalities and I guess it felt like it was part of the makeup of our relationship that we will always be having this beats. That you was even just something that our friends were like, oh, yeah, you know, the two of them are always going on and on about something or other so that's why I think for the longest time it, you know, I question if he was abusive because it was confusing to see that, you know, he's not controlling me. But what was happening was that, you know, he was as you putting me down privately and Fannin private said, it wouldn't happen in front of other people."
"The only happen in private and it will always end at the point where he would say something that hit me below the belt, say something very personal. So painful that I just do want to continue the argument. And then I will just, you know, walk away or just say, let's just continue this later. He would make comments about the things that it like. Are you sure you want to eat that? Do you even care about how you look like, you know, so-and-so is exercising and she looks so good and like, why can't you be more like he couldn't help but let it get to me."
"Because that you don't just at that. We'll just slowly slowly creeping. He said it so often that it just, yeah, it made me start to ask myself. Should I eat this cookie? Should I look more like this? This person. We each have different sort of careers, might have a bit more creative uses a little bit more professional and say, like if you, if you left it to me, I could I will be able to do it myself though. That would be able to do it. You can do it always turns into a, but he could also do it or he could do it, but I thought we had our boy. I think the abuse just release like"
Took a big time and it got very direct.
"You're so incompetent and can't do anything like my time. You just get it right? What kind of mother are you it so difficult to just keep hearing that I'm already feeling inadequate as a new mom. I'm already tired stress, sleep-deprived exhaust that and then you know, for him to come in like at Acme."
"Yeah, it was just very difficult. I said, excuse my behavior because I was thinking, maybe he's just stressed at being a new debt, like responsibilities and stuff that kind of blocked him out and I just likes it. You know what, just let me deal with it. And I just went on with figuring out how to apparent that myself and he focused on work and then, you know, so then it became more like a oh, yeah, you know, I'm here I am like bring home the bacon, bring the money, and then, so appreciate his question. But yeah, what you do all day, and I'm so difficult that may be because it happened when I was parenting. So, you know, even though the abuse was at its worst, I had to be very protective of myself. I had to have a strong sense of self-preservation because I have this child is under my care. So is that I cannot have fought the breakdown and that they had a knife. I fought"
"The more he kept trying to like put me down and attack me. I just called super ridiculous. I couldn't find that I might going on. Why is it that is all you're doing? Like how come our relationship has been reduced to this state? He was trying to throw things in the house that used to be just throwing things at say like the door or the wall. And the things just that it lending closer and closer to me before that. He would come home drunk and then throw things around the house, but this instead of his right scary because it happened but he was not drunk. I was like, oh shit. That means is he mad? I can't even blame it on the alcohol anymore. I didn't even realize that it was abused. I just saw it as she was out of control and he needed help, tell myself. So if I say my husband in and suddenly became crippled, I wouldn't abandon him, right?"
So I saw it in that same the same night.
"And I told my friends that that's why I'm staying on and then one and then my friend said yeah, but even if your husband is in a wheelchair and he's telling you things that you're useless, you're a lousy that's also the wrong way and I'll say oh, yeah, that's true."
"I think for me the last straw was when he started saying things to our son. So he used to be very just between him. And I just in private to the pie that she stopped being in the same room with him. I would just end up putting outside the bay and just end up falling asleep that I should have just a boy then come inside the room. And you know, my son is sleeping and then you just open the door. And so you just have sausage again, is it? You don't care about music and my son would wake up and start saying things to my boy. I like he cares about you. She doesn't care about me. And then, the more I tried to stop that the more he will escalate and say, you have forgotten how to be a wife. He just started shouting at me and insulting me in front of off of Austin."
"And I think so as as recent as last year. So that's why I said was before, you know, actually as soon as he was 30 sing all this aggression, my son would actually stand in front of me and put his arms in front of me to candlelight protect me."
"and,"
"I was like, this is not what I wanted for."
Fall Out Boy. I like this is not the kind of childhood in the kind of life that I want for him. I don't want him to grow up thinking that he has to protect me. I don't want him to grow up thinking that
"Daddy's show at Mommy's house and growing up thinking that this is acceptable behavior. This me every single conversation argument is West. It just end up making me feel like questioning myself. Wondering how to make him feel, better. Wondering how to de-escalate the situation so that my son does not see us arguing and see him being aggressive."
It's so stressful. I was just say.
Hyper Vigilant all the time. Trying to watch out for signs of him becoming emotional becoming aggressive.
"But even then I still didn't I didn't even realize that was a victim of you is because I didn't realize that these things that he was doing. I am I mine always thought abuse was. I imagine it was a husband who control his wife not allowing her to go out no longer than the other people, controlling finances, controlling."
"Who she sees, you know, her movements, but she didn't do all these things."
Men to keep me in a weekend or Montana bolt position.
"that's when I realized one day when I was like, reading this checklist of why is emotional abuse and then I was like,"
"You know, I'm my phone night, checking out. This is all the things that he did."
Next Sunday. Oh Me. Oh My God.
"The temperature must very ironically empowering because it made me realize that it's not me. It's not my doing, it's being done to me."
"I had no part to play in. This thing. Happening to me, is entirely his choice of behavior. His choice of action is choice of interaction for me. My part was to sort of realized it."
"I'm perpetuating the cycle is that to make plans for what I needed to do that, where I called, Keith's to find out what I should do, what I can do. And both of them told me to have a safety plan. So get my safety plan. My safety plan was to leave anything happens. I go to my mom's house and I also had this sort of light pass code with my friends. So I didn't know this thing, right? That was going around. Like, if you, if I text you that I want to Walnut brownie. That means I'm in danger. Please call the boys and I had the Irish movie, my friends. Actually on the day that I left. I actually did feel like I was in danger, such that I wanted to call the police."
"So what happened that day was sex. First thing in the morning, and then he said, it raging at me over something. Very innocuous, you know the whole week off as being in the house and him being in this right. Aging would I spend the entire week? Just trying to keep him calm, so I was completely burnt out and I don't know how I can keep doing this, but I'm really going to break down already. I felt like I needed to leave. I need it to take action, and I just wanted to go to my mom's house and he didn't let me leave and I told him that if you don't let me leave, I'm going to call the police."
"So, I just didn't know if you don't want me to call the police, and just let me leave, let me go and let me just take a breather. And, you know, I promise I'll come back and we can talk about it again. So, I promise he let me go by. I'll, I packed up and took my kid and we left. And then once I got to my mom's, then I called him and I said,"
"It's over. I'm not coming back, taking a short break, something by supporting Virginia, parents believe in Saving children nicely and respectfully, even if Michael parenting, can help us learn more about those issues in order, to bring intergenerational cycles of Island, respectful parenting, parenting, Effectiveness training and non-violence / compassionate communication. This is important because part of the process of understanding yourself, Ouija boards down."
"I'm texting you because everyone is a product of Nature and nurture, right? Little tip from chocolate zero. For young parent. Wondering how they can talk to their children about the topic types of sexuality and body activity Communications, open authentic and developmentally appropriate for children, living room for them to be independent thinkers."
You can follow them on Facebook and Instagram except 20sg email at connect a message on Instagram. If something happens. That's something private party OD and Nicole at something private.
"I'm in a better place now, but I still feel a bit disconnected because mentally I feel safer. I feel most secure but emotionally I ever have broken because I didn't want to end up being like this. And also, obviously, I loved him a lot. That's why I try so hard and I felt so hot, but if I see myself walking on the pot off being divorced and leaving him. I actually haven't that way, if you do the emotion sauce,"
What's going to happen to you? I just saw the pirate thing. One syphus.
"And maybe I will process is so Lila right now. I'm just focusing on myself. My son and my friends. Thinking that I should be happier. I'm not necessarily have you, I'm safer, but I'm not like see Dr. Rayna's thing because I'm I'm grieving, grieving for the line. I thought I had the love. I thought I had. I'm still trying to understand what happened to be honest."
"I mean, I was reading this book on healing and it said that the kind of love that the Survivor experience with the abuser."
It wasn't love just that. It's
"A conditional love is kind of like find my unconditional love. Now. I have to run enough to support me to support my son. So she in this whole situation, very scary to, not have Financial 69. Yeah, and because I stopped working and we sat at rely on this evening. So that's kind of why I was so busy Pizza. I'm also relying on my family for support her financially as well. One of the things that I kind of struggle with was also,"
"Do I let my son still see him? And I think I also realized that my son has a very conflicted relationship with him because he has seen, you know, the father like, lashing out at me. But yet they also had that one moment of like play time. I did consult my therapist and my therapist actually said that biological father is irreplaceable. And it is, if the father is willing to be there and yeah, I'm in here."
"A super healthy that are super great dad, but it's it is important that he's there in a centralized but because I grew up with a single parent life. My son to have two parents said, when you know, should I set to see that I was going through all this and I felt night and also do I am thinking about you so"
"This is not how I wish, I would. I wonder if you lie. It's just no choice ready, and it's just for the better. And then what she said to me was that you can have a funeral normal structure family."
"Who is dysfunctional and you can have a broken family? That's actually more functional and she said, what you're doing, is making it more functional for your son. So even though it is going to be"
"A difficult transition for him. Living in a new place living separately, but is actually going to be much better for him. Emotionally. Mentally for me is, why is it so important for me to be in a good place? Because I'm the one that's bringing him up."
"Okay, before this right? Like when we were the priority of"
"How you take care of yourself? Is that you have is a fuss and a marriage comes after that. Then the children. I have to rescue myself to take care of my son. A second request respectful parenting for and it's just a community of parents who follow this. Approach them. Anyways, I'm any sort of schools of thought. Yeah, but I'm in this group. I follow up. What is calari. All right, so they be fundamentally. Believe that children are not inherently capable beings and their individual already hold individual beings in the sense that they are not born. My empty vessels thoughts to own opinions. That one personality and asparagus is our our role is actually just too."
"Facilitate learning experience and their Journey because ultimately is their life that they're going to delete, his nose was going to happen. Five years from now, 10 years from now, the wall is going to be so different. Right? So if you tell them be an example in our time of my mom's time, be an accountant or a lawyer, be a doctor, then you will be set for life. I don't necessarily so. But what I can do to support my son is to make sure that he knows what about you. Make sure he knows what is a healthy relationship with him so that he will not be"
"Susceptible to, I'll be less susceptible to be manipulated so that he can see that. I know this is wrong. I should not be shouted at my worst fears that he will either become a victim. Like me or become an abuser, lies dead. So, I'm doing everything I can to show my son. What a healthy relationship is like to teach my son about your emotions about communication about nice about feelings. And because I am imagining what a dick that he's getting a different messaging when he goes over to his dead. So then I have to be extra strong and extra point that about my messaging and also because I feel like society's messaging is also very unhealthy in the sunset negative emotions are frowned upon expressing of emotions are frowned upon Jesus, Cena something unpleasant, like you say, no,"
The expected to explain why you should explain to you. Why? What would you say?
You all suck present circumstances.
"frowned, upon voided having this conversation with with, with anyone basically because"
I didn't like the idea of them.
"Looking at me and feeling sorry for me. Actually, there is still that uncomfortable feeling about having been a victim and also having to label him as an abuser. And at the same time, I also going to be given sorry looks and be seen as a weak person or as a answer annoying questions. Like why didn't you leave Alia or? Didn't you see this when you first got together with him?"
"He's like no, I would have left, right?"
"But I mean d, but these are the questions that I ask myself. Why didn't I leave earlier? I have to answer myself as it to myself, like, why? But I feel quite hopeful for the future. I don't know what's going to happen. But I feel that. Okay, at least I'm safe. I know how to manage my son. We have a great relationship. I mean, he's only five, but he's so expressive and you so much for his age. And yeah, I forgot positive."
"App for the future, although I do know what's going to happen."

"With the whole idea of engaging, the community the challenge, then comes."
Tightening the gap between the two different islands is happening. How do I
"The result results that have happened in around the offenses of devices that, you know, all what was that?"
"biggest question about,"
"How is society? How are young people looking at relationships as an expression of your gation of women, the respect, the boundaries between boys and goes. On the top of relationships. People have missed, and they're also because of the covid-19 situation. Highlighted."
"ask question, like I mentioned earlier, the white people is a week of legislation are going to be"
"More about mindset changes. So that you mentioned in the past violence, only happened. I think we have is quite clear that stakeholders, people. Who care."

"If we do not go at the root causes the problem. I want to know if you want to see that, you know."
What about the situation in a different way of looking at it is to look at the different types of violence.
"The Winston Family Violence, is it? Because this is a young couple who are facing Financial stresses, who have many children and feeling ill equipped to handle it. Is it, this type or is it a situation of Mexico instance stress from having too many on a daily basis to some form of violence? The cost of bricks."
"The reason why the potential issues around it and how we me start thinking about Solutions. And this is where we work with our stakeholders. We work with people because it's not, just an academic understanding or theoretical understanding or using the, our kind of important area of work."
Then we have to go deeper. And why are our young men?
Thinking about women.
What kind of content to think about?
"Why is it that a woman can be used to? Women? Doesn't inhibit them. Where is it at the show? Of self-regulation has become so low. And the question is, what is it? Really just about education that we have honest conversations about constantly reading online."
"Are there songs, where buys? Because otherwise every single kiss has his assistant and can we do something about the issue? Nip it in the butt, then collectively identify."
Young and old.
"Even maybe how men think about the issues. But I think one thing is very clear, which is Singaporean have a very strong sense of what is fair. And I think we talked about"
"I mean, whether or not, we agree, I think the average male is perhaps visit be stronger than the average female. So, there is that. And so, I think there is violence against a vulnerable vulnerable person. I think we are agreed that This, and That Was Then."

Tell me a grown adult because like it or not.
It's an offense for someone to have a perspective view on something that has happened.
"Wetumpka is Eagle for you, think about it this way, and it might be a function of, you're not bringing your background and improving the situation. And I think, people know that we should be a problem. Like I see some of it, some of it."
"Talking from young children, what they see around them."
Around them on mine.
"Enough of this around, this is more right about it. But this is more healthy for you to look at women. This way. Is it right for you to treat a vulnerable person that we you know, wanting to see that, you know that it is morally not right for you to do that working."

"Lucky young families against the once in a while. I haven't had someone. See, I haven't had that in your in your face is already because they know is not right to say that if it's like the rear emblem."
"Is society. Like someone just woke up for you and say, I think you're a woman and I don't, and I think not."
"If you are the woman who it is, interesting that you mention this actually, because I was in a recent president with the organization."
"And the middle president, brought up that she had read online that serious, about what the women office holders were at."

"You really want to talk about before begin. Let me just introduce what toxic masculinity is manhood. Okay, this we all know, but what about toxic masculinity? This refers to a subset of violence, destructive, or oppressive Behavior has performed in an attempt to live up to a mythological idea of masculine. See what you think, patriarchal society, where men are mostly d-des late. I mean, you look at our whole, you know, a roster of all presidents after what's 50 +."
"Bet you wait, this soft like oh Manna leaders, you know how many to mention cry?"
"You put that before men cannot Cry, tears down and I swear, I've seen everything is of cry to me. I have definitely seen him cry from like stress from work. And it gets to a stage with reheated."
"Exactly. Exactly. OK, Google energy. What are some behaviors in your distress? Which I think is, is Bella and appearance of hotness. Number 3, Miss Virginia's control of women, terrible, and number for violence or aggression as an indicator of powers. You don't be so aggressive to show that you can be in control in different ways to write on the converse, right? Sometimes I feel like I have to be aggressive as a woman to prove my place. So what are the things you do? Like, for example, if I am, if I'm in a situation where it's mostly men, I will need to cancel establish. My dominance is essential that they don't walk over me, or they don't take me as like a"
"Opinion. I have to look over compensate for that. Sometimes in very, very light mayo, lettuce nutrition in what situation. So you made some that way. Sometime. It didn't work. Not this line of work, but sometimes like other gigs, right? Where is like a lot of males, leading the whole project and thing. You know that they have a very traditional view of like, oh whatever the mail says has more power than the female become. That's when you feel like when you say something that you just feel that they're not taking you serious. That's the kind of thing. I feel a bit more dominant than be like the female. Okay, nevermind. I will just let my feelings."
"What is solo? Female friends, or colleagues, a Spectra important? So I have an uncle, right? Very traditional family must be about 65. In TV, shows his love in a different in a different form. So he is over his wife, which is my auntie and she's 3. This holiday, aha, the furniture. What kind of things did people die of future house? Should be like something like that. But it all comes from a Viewpoint where the father when he loves his daughter and he really wants the best for he's doctor and he's afraid that the doctor may be too young to know. What is actually right? What kind of wood would last for example of what kind of flooring you know, as well."
"Okay to clean that kind of thing. I mean, I know it comes from a good place, right? But I think when it gets too much, I don't think we should use excuses, you know, like but it comes from a good place or old. But this is how he shows his love because I think it's still wrong that. I mean, I'm not taking this case. Oh, yeah, but you have islands is another thing likely let you know. None of my family members are usually stronger. In terms of the words that use the interesting thing is a lot of people to their wedding, but I think it is"
"I sent like GoDaddy how many people do you want to invite? Cuz I need to look for a venue. I need to think about all this surprise me. You know, he said it's up to you to give me the choice of a traditional man. He he gave me the choice. Actually, I think it's when point is you're getting married."
"No, no, no, no. No. No, I'm just, I'm just taking me and I brought it out right in front of my parents. Getting ready to cut steel is respect your friends and you want to say yes? Hundred percent. Yes. Before you proposed to go see a parent in secret. Yes, and then I'll be proposed and if she said we can go I've already asked."
"Perseus, okay. Go before we go in deeper into this episode, just to know what we are. Not saying that all men are talks it, but certain Behavior can be and everyone men or women are capable of such behavior. In fact, did you know, there's a thing called toxic femininity on the streets that, you know, I kind of indicative of women like for example, emotional manipulation that you use that to get what you want you again. But not against your partner will leave this. Whenever I think this is enough to cover one episode on its own is, what? Interesting? Today. We are all here to learn about how toxic masculinity, not only affects women, but men themselves and society, as a whole is real issue is a societal problems."
"Is changing rooms. This cultural Mecca. Exactly. Like I said earlier, men cannot cry. Men cannot show weakness."
"Okay, I think. Oh, real men need to be strong. And you mean physically like Wyatt? Exactly."
No problem. No problem.
"Real men, you know right where we talked about like growing up very high school for your interactions are very limited talking and it's a different perspective. Do I think when I watch stuff for example, right? Like drama as the movies with avalin, I see the streets, right? It doesn't make sense to me, and it makes me angry, like, what kind of trees like"
"What if I do? I tell you are making me angry. So angry. Basically, I think he's like maybe correct me if I'm wrong, but I think maybe this might be quite typical of an Asian."
"How's the real parents of that age? For example? Okay, so it's a family with 3dr. Okay. The first one is married off to a dentist. Okay, he's Choice. The second one is now being proposed to by a guy. She has no feelings for okay, although she dated him for it for years, but she's just done with him. Okay, and he really wants to marry her, but it's one of those like Mary child convenience, you know, and you realize to do this all the time, pushing so hard for this because he works for his dad. All the business thing is he and he's pushing so hard for it, and it's crazy because right now, she's trying to make a stand for a self. And she's trying to say that I'm not going to be happy you, right? And he already forced the other one to do it, right?"
"This is a Freight Tools right now, what's happening? So she's been keeping a file of all the injuries and she's asking for a divorce right now, but the guy refuses to Let Her Go."
"And it's just abusing her like emotionally physically and everything else. And every time yet discussions and Father's, passing the second daughter to get married right here. And the first one would just leave remotes. Like, why would you want to unhappy like me, you know, and then I think,"
"Plus maybe culturally for them. That's a lot of negative connotations with getting divorced, for sure when she's pushing for a divorce. Right? And finally got to the father. So, basically, everyone already knew and when everybody, when he found out that she was being abused and everything, obviously, they were like heartbroken right now, but when it came to her father and you expect him to put your daughter or anyone else, right before anything, but he was so upset and he said, things like, everyone makes me sick, just thinking back on this, but I do agree that growing up. I think a lot of my opinion of men and how they should act didn't come for. My parents thought they came from TV, dramas Korean dramas movies."
"Two years ago, I watch Crash Landing on you like the way she holds the door open for the girls."
"By the way, it's like the fact that she got, she doesn't just hold it all for the girl that he likes. He holds about any stranger and he passes by and I feel like if you offer to pay for meals is great, but it is of course how we expect men to key on a date in the way, expect them to pay less than to hold the doors. Are we expect them to come and maybe pick us up in the car and the car? Payment toxic femininity. I think that expectations lad has a just expectations of ideas and whether or not they can be translated into reality is an entirely different story altogether."
The doors might just all kinds of behaviors like Jordan. He ultimately holds my back's but sometimes he may very well forget that I'm walking along with him. And then you just go to that door. Just leave me behind.
Show me holding a bat. See if nothing on your hands. Open the door and this is when Donna will come in and see baby. This is. Listen to some kind of like a behavioral.
"Nola. But I think he gives in to me a lot. I mean I guess you that's true but a lot of times it's great that same page. Everything is a compromise. Everything's a discussion for sure. Yeah, so I don't think a long time since we should do that. That's very sweet. But in Singapore, poly. Anyone. I said, I want all the top of the door for you open for me to do, but can you"
"This is what a real man should act. Like your sense of like, toxic masculinity is when you do anything, right? And then, I always expected to make the first move men have to pay for the first date. Like that is toxic masculinity, even if you think it is acceptable for me that that would not exist this notion. That is true that you guys might not take us seriously, because we say, we want to fight will a woman rides and everything is equal and we're independent. But we still expect them to be on the first day."
"Okay, we got to get there. Okay. So who comes to mind when you think of toxic masculinity is the best example, is Boys in school? I think, you mean, back in secondary school, day at school and one guy, and he was made fun of by all the other guys for being with us and he's like better than he's a very, very good deal with that though."
"Guys, we we at school. Yeah, it is. But you know what? Maybe these boys are like. If you think about it, when you think you'll end it for him, you know, somebody must have seen me. A hand. For example, has a more feminine form of maybe in societies from society's view. Point exit to be more aggressive house of blowing gentle with movement, correct? Okay. So yeah."
Toxic masculinity.
"I think we're very lucky. We really choose the kind of people we hang out with. And then, for sure, we will filter out in my circle is always more dominant in a relationship with your friend."
"Yeah, we will reflect our savings and kicking. No, it's okay. Go."
"Are you behaving? Are you seen that new? Go go out know? I mean it, okay, if I'm out of school that I don't have to let you know, we're worried about Maria and be angry. If I can only stay over for example, once every two weeks and under one night of, cuz I would expect him to come home a bit early, and spend some time with me other than things will be different. Now, it's different from the way people see, men, say 10, 20 years ago or definitely. I mean, when you look at our like, grandparents to write the males, are the only ones working, females traditionally."
"Yeah, I seen is very very different and I think men it more acceptable for men to show their emotions these days because like we have internet. Now, we got social media, we can see multiple and we are exposed to light a lot of Role Models. Like, for example, Shawn Mendes, write everyone thought that, you know, he's very, very good. Yeah, and he was okay and so much. Do you know, I think. Yeah. Yeah, people that, by the way, so I think we haven't completely moved on yet from the kind of flight view of us, but I think that's nothing to"
"I mean, definitely I think I'll take a long, long time, you know, but we're getting there. I think more people are speaking out as well. I think especially lost the event, a pandemic and everything. You know, I think we started seeing more people on my invoicing out about how, like, don't forget, the guys have feelings as well. That a lot of them are struggling that, you know, the increase in calls from like helpline and help centers. Basically. Yes, they saw a huge increase in the number of guys calling in ya, ya, have you ever heard? This is where people tell boys Cymbalta."
Other guys.
A sofa.
"So why you must have been Furious right to say no when I'm very angry. I see things that you can take back. I wish I could take back that being used before you grew some balls, a lot, especially on social media platforms as well. So I also want to bring up this example. This is a vlogger, can't I want to see me strong engine and he has 1 million subscribers on YouTube. He's only Twenty-One years old is so special about him, is that he reaches his hair. He put some heavy makeup lipstick on point and he's very vocal about the topics that he discusses on YouTube. He's not afraid to swim people. He's not afraid to wear skirt. Like I said, and and do a video how many people make"
"Just whatever you're doing, but she doesn't, she doesn't care. So I think he's a very good example of not surrendering to this whole toxic masculinity. He's really who he is and he believes that he's happy. Is this way? I hear a lot of grow, some balls from voice."
"The other one to say it a lot actually about like other guys like that, say he's going through. He's like kind of a girl. Then, he's his guy friends. But if you really want a girl, something vagina vagina every month, view goes beneath that gen Z will put an end to toxic, masculinity nail polish and stuff like that. And previously right used to be considered to be no getting me how to put on my makeup."
"Talk to Miss Community, but I'm sure it will go somewhere a lot. He was on a livestream. Okay, when are we going? Everything's going, all right, and then I think a guy left a comment and said you"
"Something like what does bunch of boys? Who look like girls with makeup on or something like that. And I'll definitely about BTS and why you? And she saw that comment and you read it out. Okay, and he sit, you know, this kind of, and this kind of heat. Should I really give you attention? And then he just turned away for a bit and then he came back and he said, you know what, I've been wanting to bail. You. Remember this, no matter what you'll never be able to make a goal. Scream as loud as I can. Do you use a bow and Hinata love it. I love it."
"Best comeback ever. And I think that I would appreciate this changed over change the way we think about men, and how they act or behave, we have a possibly thinking about opening the car."
"Maybe we try this missing their toxic behaviors by saying all, is because they are just boys home yet, but we cannot use that to be playful boys at the snow. I don't think that's about it at all her. And this kind of like manifest in in very very nice of you always liked women harassment, like a fool. You cannot accept it. Once you accept it, you are giving them power. We are giving in to this toxic masculinity. Exactly that group chat. Sorry. I didn't let you know, objectifying body parts and stuff like that. That is all really, really talks. Again sometime."
"As a female in a group of guys, right? You feel like you have to join in. Yeah. How you feel that you have to deal with it. For example, look at photos of other women together. With your guy friends. You don't eat all kind of woman, is this be an issue? Thankfully, I think things are changing up. So if the women is the one cooking, then the name will be the one clean up. And okay, I wash"
"Yeah, it is from the way we women think, as well, like we mentioned just now. So, what do you think are the kinds of behaviors of mine? Says that women have that contribute to toxic masculinity? I would say like for example, in last episode I talked about how I would love to be showered with gifts. That is me perpetuating, toxic masculinity because I expected I should be in a completely full. Well I should have what you can only if you do, what you also let me know. And then he doesn't appreciate the fact that nobody thought of them shopping and just like it."
It's is like breast milk.
You know where it could have been the meat like Rings or light pendants with like the retinol in it. That's nice. You think I would want to do that? When you mean to me?
"What are some of the mindset that think women hair that will perpetuate? Toxic masculinity coming? From my point of view? I think I put a lot of expectations on Jordan and he has to remind me that baby. This is double send that coming from your side. Okay, if I don't, if I don't perform the same way, I have no rights to ask him to do the same thing for me. Do you think so, what is an example of a simple? You expect them to hold. It usually is, but a lot of things you would have seen, like, I hold for you. I would help me back to my most probably wouldn't go into the air, above your hair bad for you."
"I will expect him to pee fall meals and is something I think it's been toxic talk of food. If it's only like $5 for me, what they could be sweet if you can just pay for it. But if you go out for fine, dining is a special occasion. Like it is. Busy, of course, is my treat. If it is my birthday because you be treating me, but we just would like to go out for dinner and I think it's fair that we go dutch right now. I feel like"
"Though, the weights are we just like talking about when we bring the bill right? To the new, always go to GPS, is not like a zero-sum game where we have to let you burn it out, but then, it's because of learning effect that they will go to him first. Then I'll be like, oh no, he can't make you feel a sense of a bill fleshman. Yeah, that sounds like I feel like that perpetuates the bill to the table. Depending if you don't ride with someone,"
"What I seen you look Louis true that the influenza many years ago before she was married or attached to a common husband. She was talking about her ex-boyfriend and her ex-boyfriend with, pick up hot and make payments. So, in other people's eyes, it seems like the boyfriend is paying for the new but actually the contact name. Is it supposed to be to be? No. No. No, like I will I will just like, it's a subtle thing. It's all that it. Can you heal my cut? I was just like farts in the car. Then I'll go do something with the intention of letting him be the one to get the car. But why would you do that?"
"I don't want him to always feel that, you know, I'm paying for stuff for you are even if you're passing the car. You are the one I think. I'm think I'm more selfish it because I wouldn't pass in my car. If I'm the one paying for the view, your money. Yes. Mia. If he feels guilty which somewhere deep inside my heart. I hope he does. Ever been on your people to be all the time and I'm a bit more sensitive. So I always remember the times that I pay can be a real."
"In a relationship, I think I'm the only thing one. I will always remember my cat for him to pee. OK, Google. Okay, so that happens."
If I noticed eyes on me and I feel uncomfortable and I want to get out of the place is I will pass them my car and I will run the white spots in your cut. Then why can't he fight while you run away and never crossed your mind. So you guys have that like what's up for you to see you a deal? I don't have my own. Maybe she has been paying a few.
Not really. But I would not be happy if I'm always cooking The View.
"But the thing is, I feel cared for, I do love to know when he puts the view is like, no him. Using his hard-earned money to treat you, and that is what I think is Stan."
"This is this is me perpetuating. No. No. No, this is my next question. Have you ever been guilty of perpetuating? Toxic masculinity or subconsciously practicing. Toxic masculinity in the past? Oh, I don't like it. When you asked me where to go or where you want to eat. But I think that's the kind of thing is more like your personality. Maybe you're just not the more detailed one. Will go into the fine little thing and I don't want to do it and I don't expect you to do it to do it that. You don't like it."
"What does a monkey on where you want to eat or anywhere Casino McDonald's? No, Moolah to tell us in the first place, I have lunch to choose for myself because I want to save that. I know that I will not be okay. The choices that you picked me, will ya just pick something. You don't own the whole right? We don't know maybe because I guess we grew up in the way that we did. We don't really like expect men to take the full load of everything."
"Like we also want to play our part in the face by a relationship. That is true. So like I mentioned last episode that Jordan has his own company and then when they have projects they will have to work till like 3 a.m. To sort of relief stress, right. He would game at 5 a.m. So by the time he gets home at about 6 a.m. And I will be upset but and she would tell me that a baby. This is my way of relieving stress is because people always right cause him to come to be very weak from two different point of view, but I find that to my Horror in my heart. I would actually feel like he would man up and deal with the stress with another way, instead of gaining, you know what I mean?"
"Okay. I've been on the receiving end of this month. I'm okay. No, I don't like I'm the one who's. So this is many years ago at the southern relationship. Okay. So I'm the one who's always saying outdated stuff like that and he's not happy about it. And he's like, why why you can't see me?"
"And also I have disliked strange idea and I hate that it doesn't matter what time you know that if people say don't stay out late. Why if you go at 3, I was at night. What is the difference? Is also healthy? You don't want to hear it doesn't I will take care of that. You know. Yeah. I just thought of something that is kind of like a bit of like the picture you eating toxic masculinity in the same. Let me know. So I have not been like, okay with my partners, having very close girl, friends. Okay, female friend, email friend on the flip side, better about it. Now, it doesn't really affect me now, but in the past, when I first got the date,"
"And then I was supposed to be so, frightened of girlfriends, like, female friends. I wouldn't mind seeing naturally gravitate to write as a as a friend, and I would be very upset if he like goes out with his female friends, but then, on the flip side upon a time, I was hanging out with a lot of a toxic trait, is your boyfriend, really needs you for that female friend. It just means that, you know, you guys are not meant to be correct. You cannot make it in the long run. He said that no matter how much you control."
"Exactly, and all realize that. So why not just give him the freedom to hang out with whoever you want and solves a lot of learning points today. Okay, but in this topic, we actually cover toxic masculinity by realize that we actually gave love a viewpoint. On toxic traits can be we all need to do exactly when you talk about toxic masculinity, right? You always must look at the flick site in any debate that cause us to reflect on ourselves and realized it. Like we also have some changing to do. Yeah, and I'm sure for listeners tuning in, maybe you'll find that you have some changing our ways I can do as well. I think we can cover this in another."
"A piece of the Hoge podcast, so stay tuned for that. But to end things of how do you think can change extreme toxic? Masculinity mindset is one point for each of us. Okay. I think that, when we eventually become parents, okay, we cannot perpetuate. These kinds of like stereotypes. Boys will be boys, mentioned, as a parent. You need to tell your son, that if he can cry, let him Express his emotions that are label it as masculine or feminine for me. I think we need to drop the double standards. Whatever we want our partners. Do for us. We must be willing to defer time is apparent reason kids. I think you should not give into stereotypes, you know, especially when it comes to that."
"Isn't that going to make it like, you know, if they see something like they want to, I don't know if he would have a job that usually associate with females. For example, don't say, don't do that because it's a female job. Yeah, you can be an MMA fighter, she wants to and children, you play my dolls and play with his Legos. Okay. It's kind of like a soaking wet. So I think it is a matter of personal opinion and we can all do our part to change it for the back of your feelings are valid. We will listen to you."
"Hotness as well. We will be here to listen to your email off at hello at its clarity.com. We would love to know your thoughts. Have you ever experienced any moment in your life where you had to suppress your emotions that you really wanted to cry? Go there. Yeah, but you're like, Megan cry. I have to be stronger because of social stigma and also late, think about it. How do you practice self-care? It doesn't have to be like, but sometimes it's about like validating your own emotions and not giving yourself to space to feel, you know, how do you display your manhood that considered healthy masculinity? Healthy healthy?"
"So once again, thank you so much for listening. I'm Hazel. I was there. I will see you next time on D."
I know I had a young man came up to me at a reading and a talk. I didn't know where I think it was last year or the year before and he said that his father father is in his eighties and never reads anything but the sports section in The Straits times and he handed my erotic stories to his father and father read it in 3 days which made me really happy and I don't think that has something to do with the idea of representation that we break these taboos. When we see our people in these stories that we do these things and it's okay for us to do these things.
"This podcast feed in the edge of night spin wanted to point seven. F m b, m b, a s s festival and organized by the national Arts Council. And listen to the two full episode on swf. Now."
"Bali cordless. Well, I'm very happy to be here. I am a novelist I've written for Knoebels. So the most recent was the unlikely Adventures of the char-grill sisters. My International debut was erotic stories for punjabi widows. I've also published some meds and essays about shame and taboos and censorship and particularly in small, conservative communities. Yes. So why did you decide to write it?"
"As with all my books, there's always a growing fascination with something that then one day. So I kind of worried about this for me. I think there was always a huge fascination with women that, that, that seem to be invisible in a society, in an end, the idea of sexuality and how how he perceives that women and sexuality. So I think that was something even though I didn't quite articulate in those terms, when I was young, when I first learned about sex, as a child, like, when I was my first thought, I think everyone's first thought is they were the ones that definitely didn't do that. That, you know, and I also went further back to like"
"Mother particular just seemed so a sexual to me and I think a lot of traditional Indian women are, you know, are are perceived and and portrayed by our society as as as as not really having any sexual value or any sexuality. So I couldn't fathom that when I was young and over the years. I kept returning to that question. The reality settled in obviously that. Yeah, of course the women of that generation did have sex the other day that they had a lot of children, but what then bothered me more was, you know, it was that was that a choice on her part. She was very young when she got married. Does she know it was even happening to her? Cuz I've heard some of my friends say that their grandmother is have told them much later in life you girls these days are so lucky. You, you know, all these things because I didn't even have it. I didn't figure out the connection between sex."
"And having children until my fourth child. Wow, so did not understand all these things about their bodies and all these about this very, very fundamental thing. And I wanted to create a world where the women that kind of sex happen to, you know, I actually take charge and in control the narrative, Story collection of stories for actual job. It's a lot of people tend to think. For some reason. It's about a young British Indian woman named Nikki who signs up to teach creative writing courses at the Sikh temple in Southall in London."
"And she finds out very quickly that the women who signed up for classes, have some interest in literacy, but more interest in telling their story is and in telling stories about sex about things that they weren't allowed to talk about before. And so they start this illicit storytelling club that becomes kind of bigger and bigger and grows out of control. So I want to know what are some of the seems particularly wanted to focus on in this book and why we start at different places with with feminism and with activism and with that sense of Independence as well, let Nikki's character and he feels like she's very depressed because she grew up in Britain but her parents to her are very traditional. And then she meets these women who, you know."
"Aspira suppression on a very, very different level of a fundamental level. And she's a little bit impatient with them, because she feels that they should be, that, that she kind of feels that her job is to liberate them. And there is kind of colonial mentality that she comes in with. That was the most fascinating thing for me to explore with that. We all start from different places that these women do actually have quite a streak of Independence in them. But they've been Limited in how they could express that Independence and that's really not their fault and a lot of their conservative ideals and a lot of their outlooks on the world were necessary for survival in the context that they came from. The really want to explore how how yes, I'm across. The spectrum is really, really informed by cultural context and history."
In the book that I saw you covered bridge Independence of the sea sexuality. How much is a reflection of your own upbringing and experiences? I think the idea that there's a kind of
"but after a girl got educated then then the next step was marriage and that and that you had to have this, you do a purpose. You have a thing that you are doing things, right? Asian Asian kind of mentality of, like you always need to be hitting the next Milestone and you need to be doing something and you need to have that tight unit of a title, you know, it's true. You can't just be aimless like you have to get to stay on a treadmill and Nikki's character. Doesn't she goes to law school? Because she gets a mark to go to law school. And then when she's there she's like I don't care about this. I don't understand what's going on. She has already found her passion, this idea finding your passion is quite s re to do, you know, the pragmatism that I think our parents generation had instilled in them and want to instill in us. Things are quite different for us. We have an enormous privilege to not prioritize pragmatism, have two priority."
"Survival, I think that was that, was that tension for Nikki was very much there. I think that I that I have found quite frustrating with arranged marriage vs. Forced marriage, two, very different thing, like arranged marriage, is something that is that, that, that people do that. A lot of people very happy with and that is still done in a, in a modern context around the world with you in the Indian diaspora. Really? If you think about it, tender as kind of arranging and people together to the fact that your parents are doing. But I think that a lot of people can plate it with forced marriage. And extreme story is that they are of like young girls being dragged into these marriages with older men in rural Villages and it"
"Associating it with violence rather than love rather than you know, this is what this is. This is what families are doing to ensure that their offspring. Are. Are you? No happy ending in and staying within a context that familiar to them about? That definitely came from just my observations around me. A few, no relatives who did kind of favor at the arranged marriage, way of doing things. And who did have conservative views in my silence? Rejection of the things that could always be desperate, Tegan light."
That's why are Asian Community right in the other historic? Right? But I think like a want to know a bit about the process of y'all because it yourself in the shoes of like that. The starting quarterback in the 90s. It was a lot of kind of a lot more space on bookshelves or Indian diaspora writers and women.
"And in a lot of those stories identity was the story, you know, I dented like that, the search for identity was the story, and I feel that as we've kind of built from that we've been able to say, okay. Yes is search. Vitamin D is one aspect of it. But how about we, you know, expand on this. How about we, you know, unpack it and think about aspects of identity that we want to explore like sexuality like, you know, like bringing in humor to that bringing in. Elements of that as well. So I think that was, that was what I was trying to achieve with writing stories or Punjabi widows was being like well at our stories, yes, they can be about identity, but they can also be, you know, about about just a whole lot of other things, as well as a multi-faceted. In terms of research. I actually was only able to get to London after I had written maybe half of them. The novel, I had lived in the UK for a year when I was writing."
"Inheritance, and I had gone to sell her quite a bit because I have family friends there and I found it fascinating, like thought it was this place where India from the 1950s have basically fossilized in London. So like the street signs on the street signs were in Punjabi, you could at the time that I was there, you could pay for a beer at the pub in rupees, which I thought was really interesting and it, and there was something incredibly comforting about being in a new country yet, stepping off a train. And suddenly being in a place that felt like your family was everywhere that felt like home, but then, you know that I also thought, well, there's also something quite. There's also a downside to this into larity because it means that if you don't conform to, this can be the same people that are always around you to support. You can also turn on you, you know, or can also reject you."
"Everyone knows, everybody's business is always a good thing. When I went back to South Hall in, I had the characters in mind. I had Nikki the main character in. I had become of the different windows in mine, and I just kind of walked around observing things. As if I was them, I'd, I spoke to a friend's grandmother and nnn talk to you as a mother people that she knew. And more of the details that I got were surrounding those intimate aspects of their lives or not. I didn't feel comfortable that she asked you directly. After all I wasn't writing, you know reportage or nonfiction, but I did get a lot of good details about like when they got married about, you know, leaving their families. What was it like when they met their husbands for the first time? So those sorts of things. What is what, what is a common experience?"
"Marriage marriage is kind of happened. Like, it was like they came of age as an excuse to go and live with her husband's until they were older. So that's a detail that I put into the book yesterday. Like they're kind of promised to someone at the age of like 14, but didn't actually go and live with their husband until they were like 17 or 18. So there's a little bit of time for them to kind of prepare for marriage. Although I have questions about, you know, what, that preparation likes. I think it was a lot of years. Any how to cook here is learning how to do, you know, so his buttons on or whatever. I don't think there was any I sent that there wasn't much more about what to expect in the bedroom and and and what, you know, they were allowed to say no to or what they're allowed to do themselves."
"That, that was a curiosity, that that drove this novel. And as, as I began to kind of distinguish the characters from each other. I started to think of them as different individuals that I had seen around South Hall. I had observed and indulge their their identities from there. So they, there's a point in the novel, where Nikki, the main character of the women. Why every time they talk about genitalia, they refer a bit, they refer to it in terms of vegetables like this is over."
"Specific because the women grew up there so much taboo, and there's so much fun said, around 6, but no one actually knew what the proper words were or genitalia. How to refer to them to those things that the size and shape of a particular body can come up with is a part 2 and interesting. Lee the women say, we don't know what these words are in Punjabi. So we'll use these, but we know what they are in English and they all kind of rattle off the most, I've seen or heard for, you know, everything because they've heard that they've lived in London their kids. R kids, swearing and our kids saying those things and I thought that was really fascinating that there was this"
"Things about ourselves that we don't have labels for you can like genitalia, especially woman's genitalia is disgusting and insulting. It's the worst thing you can call someone or isn't broken up. Like yeah. So how was it by?"
"That's a good question. I have only a very positive. I've only been approached by people from the community who have, you know, who have who have seen the ways in which the communities kids can neglect women sometimes or forget about sexuality in that way. Yeah, number of them say that they love the book that they introduce the book to their parents. I know I had a young man who came up to me at a, at a reading, and a talk. I didn't know where, I think it was last year, or the year before and he said that his father was a young man. He said his father is in his eighties and never reads anything but the sport."
"Section in The Straits times and he handed my erotic stories to his father and father read it in 3 days happy. And yeah, I did that. We break these taboos. When we see our people in these stories, when we see that ya week. We do these things and it's okay for us to do these things. So, making the invisible visible for me, is really, really important as far as anyone who would like, you know, it's not happy about the portrayal of anything. I've heard whisperings here and there but it's, you know, it. It doesn't really mean much to me. If, if I'm not actually hearing it directly. It's true like it."
I can't I can't really speak about something that I haven't actually confirmed.
Someone might find it.
Let you know.
"Love you too much of them, right? Again. I haven't I haven't heard from these these Elders at all and I haven't really I've heard that sometimes like people say, oh, you know, there's there was this thing that there was some talk that someone wanted to invite likes. Neil Young seek artist 2 and then someone someone at the tops at all, but don't invite by Ally Carter all fall because she always paints are committing the negative light. Which to me is very interesting because I I speak very first day, I die."
"It's not in my interest to be a publicist for our community and I'm going to and I don't think I portray the community in a negative light at all. I think I portray it as it is. I might my my whole reason for writing fiction is to get at the truth and I don't think that it serves anyone for for us to just say no everything's fine. And remodel minorities were great. Everything's everything's working just fine because it isn't and that's okay. Like every Community has these issues and I don't see how we're going to do better for everyone. I don't care. We're going to be more inclusive if we shut people out. But again a lot of what I write about is kind of the insidiousness of that kind of, you know, that whispering and I got the beer and the people who try to kind of cut me out are actually doing all that."
"And then a network of gossiping. Auntie exactly what I want you to write about. It is true intimacy, right?"
Very interesting.
"Spiritual and experiential, they're kind of there."
"The telling me stories in a building, that's close to the Sea Temple, how to make sure to, like, make it Geographic you like to live with outside this Temple that I need the women, see the sea Temple as their spiritual Haves, and the place that kind of the heart of their culture and their community. So for them to be kind of a little bit, a little bit of Jason to hit and developing this other side of themselves developing. This is it's doing that through storytelling doing that through sharing of experiences doing that through conveying to others."
"These narratives in which they're in control, in which they have this kind of starring role. That was what I wanted to reconcile in. The novel was his idea that they actually are at heads with each other, these women are doing and that's why I kind of had them adjacent to the temple. What they're doing is actually very close to a spiritual experience as you can get there in a safe environment. They are talking about being you know, their fullest selves, they are making up for lost time and a lot of ways and they are restoring the equality to relationships that equality that the tenets of the Sikh religion was based on. You know, the idea was men and women are equal and that they are they our hearts to each other in an equal way. How do you think your story in text like the younger generation in helping them understand themselves at night?"
"Being sexual exploits sexuality is no more idea that our narratives are visible that our narratives are important. When we read stories. Are we listen to stories about people like ourselves or people who have something in common with us? So like I grew up, you know, with without much until I sort of my teens that there wasn't much in the way of stories about young. Chubby girls, navigating Singapore and that is kind of what I strive to do with with fiction and that's especially with a write stories for punjabi widows. I just wanted to tell the truth then I just wanted that the stories of the women not much the story that they tell about all this."
"I wanted that to be an entry point for people, reading that that book at whatever age that they could see the vulnerability in these characters and match it to their own. They could witness the shame of these characters and reflect on their own and realize that it's yet that they don't have to have that shame and that they're not alone in that shame. I think one of the biggest gifts that reading gave to me as a young child was the sense of there's more like you and it's okay. And I think that's what I strive to do. When I write tell me a bit about that y'all betta Bowl in the shipping company. In my life. I could always, you know, rely on fiction, to take me into Worlds that felt certain, that felt that there was some sort of"
"There's some sort of resolution. There was some ways in which the underdog could could Triumph and and, and then I think I just always was just very, very because I was such an Avid Reader. I guess my vocabulary kind of built a little bit faster than my ID but my Readiness for so and so yeah, I remember there was this concern, the one of my teachers I think was quite concerned because my mom had bought me a book that like cleaning for teenager, that was about some boy and girl on the cover of looking at each other. She's around that. So there became a lot of Shame around the idea that I like stories of that. I like to read stories that I like to write stories, like that became kind of this."
Idea that that was imposed on me. I think that that I was only reading to find out let salacious things. And also there was
I think there's still a little bit of this prejudice against reading for entertainment. For children is true about like what it like you're enjoying it. It can't be good for you and possibly be good for you. What kind of books do you like fiction books? And I meant for me to be so happy.
"I'm sorry. This happened. There is a lot of this Society has this ignorant. Fearful that, what is happening. This intimate experience that you are having with Rich and words on the page is changing you in ways that they cannot participate in, unless they're also reading the same thing. My people don't get so up in arms. If you say, oh yeah, I've been used all of this flight on Orthodox on Netflix. They're like, oh, there is that? That's an experience that I can also have. This book was so good. You tend to get a lot of light eyebrow-raising you tend to get a lot of me. Why don't you get a life?"
"A lot of Suspicion around the intimate relationship that I had with books because it couldn't lead to anything good in. You know, you were loved books and imaginative world. You couldn't be in touch with reality reality. Like empathizing with people like the world is so much more varied than it. Is that that then it appears to be came from fictional books because fiction is often about truth. It's adjacent to the truth. So yeah, to meet to me that that suspicion is something that's very that that that, that created a lot of Shame and something that I really have to work around because I was very, very ashamed of writing stories. I think I was told that there was a place for it like an composition class to get an A. Yes, write a good story and yes, you're a good writer, but, you know, there's a place for that, but"
"If I wanted to write on my own it was just like, yeah, it was seen as it was, it was dismissed very quickly. It was seeing, as what, why you making up all this story, is that, it seems like the way you sit around and lie all the time, you make up things. I took me a long time to actually get past that. But a teacher in school in primary 3,"
"I think a group of friends and I like started our own like like detective, detective stories and very quickly. I realize that they're all these. There were these like salacious or like taboo things in stories that I didn't quite understand like that. Had to do it. Like, you know, I think I must have gotten hold of a romance novel at some point and there is some very exciting things happening in that, start with writing like those scenes as well, and passing them around. And I think that's right. One of our earliest, like"
"Ways of learning about sex, probably it'll same way that the widows and put it in their writing stories. For punjabi widows kind of develop their knowledge about 6 years and years after their first time, there was a silence around it, they share detail and then one day like the class tattletale or someone, I can remember, who someone infiltrated our group and told the teacher about it. And I just, I just remember there was a lot of tension. There was a lot of, like, like the other girls will I call. You know, what, the teacher found on. You were the one who made us do this you, you started this. So they all kind of distance themselves from me. And then we were supposed to take our bags out for PE with us. Like we always did. And that one day, the teacher said, only leave your bags here. When you go off for p. E. S, kind of to give me a look when I came back and we all came back to our bags. My folder full of stories, have been taken from my bag. She confiscated it out of my bag, and she kind of joked about it later in the year."
"When you going to come and get your stories from me, but that that trust has been broken. And I like to take something in there was just so much. I didn't want to really confront her. I didn't really want and I was so young. I was like, eight-years-old I have done wrong cuz you know I died. But there was so much shame associated with it. That is stuck with me for a while. It was, it was like, you know, you're you're you need to, you need to grow out of this. You need to exploration and stories that you enjoy. So much, is because you have a dirty mind. Is that idea? And it was like you. Yeah, you you love story so much. You enjoy them so much because there's something wrong with you that I found really frustrating. I wonder if that is something that boys experience to. I'm not sure, I felt like as a girl in a, in a Catholic school. There was a lot of Shame associated with retreating into a world. That was not the world that everyone else was it. But having that Independence to go into,"
The world. Did you find things out for myself? There was something very dangerous about that.
"For a very long time. I yes, I continue to try to write for a while and composition class, always got kind of fighting the praise from teachers and that regard within the confines of, you know, the rubrics kind of filled me. But then for a while that in my teens, I think it was when I was in grade 10, and I had a teacher like a short story to us. Anyway, we actually didn't do any creative writing and that cost it was if we don't bite by kind of site, Jayceon words, you just doing it, is abandoned by creativity, is this is not important where any serious things now. And she just said, I'm so sick of all of you writing all these like, you know, discussion."
"Fixing this, this Big D's big Exposition Expedition. As I just want you to write something fun. So bright, right? As create a story for homework based on the novel that we're reading the story that I put a lot of my heart into it has been a very long time. Since I had written anything creative and I like I crammed it at the bottom of my school bag and refused to hand it in and she kind of hounded me about it for about 2 weeks. She said he going to get a zero and it in my hand and what you've written and I was like no no, no, I can't I can't and she was just like whatever you have to send it in. Otherwise they are. You going to fail your class."
"Yes, I my teacher handed back, my work to me, and she wrote, this is so good. That I'm going to forgive, it's lateness. Whatever you do. You must keep writing. And that was really, the thing that I did not the reason that I'm here today. You know, I think it's someone saw me."
"Yep, someone someone saw that I had this desire to write that. I had a story to tell and that I love to do this so much. And someone said you need to keep doing this. Clearly. This is something you love to do. This is something you're good at doing and yeah."
"Howard that that desire to write kind of get became revived and then I haven't stopped since I think. All right, I think that in the last couple of years has grown quite a bit, but listen to buy a ring like I would say to read read, read, read, read, widely, it's amazing. How many people approached me to say that they want to write a book but they don't particularly like to read. But you know,"

Because I think there is a lot of pressure for us to be a particular Identity or to know who we are. And I think the older we get the more, I realize that it's actually a work in progress."
So many people seem to think that that that there's a deadline. That's a cut off point by which they need to. I figured it all out. I need it. Just it just doesn't have to be that linear.
Dancing in uncharted waters intertwined.
"Intimacy dresses themselves in red, red, red tones, stock and distinct. And the depth in spirit of a nun. Nepsy draped around their body. A confidential secret and Adventure, unlike any other,"
"Feet first and gulfton Coldwater leaves. My phone's parched seared By ignited Flames of fear. My sight was eclipsed by the Embers in mimic of a skull, a crossbone crushed. Cut of an internal scream, a warning of mislaid trust a loss of control and unforeseen pain."
"Feet in up to the waste. It becomes a warm embrace, akin to sharing a plate of Mala. With a loved one, buying chicken essence for your child before examinations or even sitting on the steps along Singapore. River with a friend or two and more talkin Luxor cup noodles in hands and more."

"Jumped out to me. The most was there, when they were talking about intimacy. It didn't send me your credit line. Secret connection."
"Yeah, I thought, I thought the writer did a lot to kind of try to Define Intimacy in terms of universal things. Like the color red, like, big big draw things. But I'm also very, very specific experiences. This is what the writer. Also, thinks of intimacy for themselves. You know, with that. The loved ones are walking along the Singapore, River or something. So this this very, very big word in the context of their experience."

"In my previous relationships, I realize that we did not have intimacy. They were filled with walls fortified with anger, and insecurity and offered no room for vulnerability. Especially For Crying past partners, were so uncomfortable with crying or comforting. Me, instead tears were met with defensive remarks and debilitating statements, the lack of respect comfort. And consent on many occasions. Left me angry, disappointed and broken."
"I'm at my current partner. Soon, after our relationship survived and flourished. Even when I thought it was doomed before it again, sharing details of my trauma with my partner was terrifying, the intimate, but I found a reservoir of patience and kindness soon. I felt empowered by his support to begin counseling and join a support group in return. My partner trusted me enough to cry and let me comfort him something, no one else, but I had seen"

Why can you see the internet connection is somebody unless?
"Miss Isabella, I don't know. I do have it off."

And again, it comes back to that definition of intimacy is so interesting that they are as there that that that that we do, we Define intimacy so much according to our experience with it and this discussion is Kaylee talking about, you know, that what what wasn't there when you know, what? What didn't what didn't constitute is intimacy? And then discovering what intimacy was because of what was absent before? I think that's very powerful."
"A movie about our relationship and the immediate thing that comes to mind is yeah. When how do I say or what is intimacy to me or ya think that? And in terms of those five different types of intimacy is that you mentioned as well. Like, that makes me think even more about, you know, to finding it on very personal time and experience to look, you have to connect it to brush my teeth out as a word or is it something to Define when I was younger, like, when I was a kid?

So that's like a definition that we go by."
"I think, because some of our friends have encountered Rumors in the past, actually, one of our team member or friend was of the four of us back in secondary school online. And that stranger was like, at least 10 years older than secondary school. And so, you know, I think I'm the reaction that she ain't that the friend group had was that it's very negative.

We really saw a lot of like, sexually explicit messages that you wouldn't send to a fourteen-year-old life for yourself, the song Precious. And so, you know, are you know, that was just so many like sexual innuendos in those, conversations that I think at 14-13 15, you wouldn't really know what they are until you tell someone that you trust about them."
"Who's of the situation where after that, she just how many years until she met? You guys didn't, you know, a few years back, but the decisions that she made is still influenced by him.

I cannot really say, for sure as well because of the fighting one good thing for you to do is to step out even acknowledge."
"So then, they are in a better position to really pinpoint, where the red flags that is this a possible grooming situation and then be critical in terms of online who they talk to and then pick up the reflex.

I went for my underarms and I had an ingrown hair. When you have entered the laser over it, it's that before. So that's something to keep in mind. If your ingrown hair, you got to try to get it out first before you leave there. I can help you like, separated, in good hands because it's inside. Okay, I once had a friend who went for an IPL treatment and the next day right? There were like lasermax all over and is very regular."

I realize this is lot better, especially when the girl fight when was is a full of self-worth problem. I mean, which I mean both parties might have something to play how to play. But more of the fuel that is very basic insufficient insufficient. In what? Way? Like they accomplished men, perhaps your relationship."
And the things that your partner might not like about you is something that you feel you might want to change or someone else is crazy about that. We look for things that are obviously lacking in a relationship. And then sometimes when do people find outside again? And let me know what is it to some people have a partner that 80% right for them 20% and then you truly 80% just abused 20% to find out that it now only have 20%. I know you do.
"You dislike the screen brightness to buzz me. How do you say loyal? I mean, I've come across many situations and I've met people as well. They have presented themselves, as you know, upon Temptation right now and go to events. You party, many people that you can click with connect with, you know, any of the spur of the moment. You're like, wow, like this. Purse is so awesome. And when I think of my relationship with Jeremy, I go back to my answer of making conscious decisions because I feel like when you are drinking and when you're drunk and you made me a lot of bad decisions, sometimes involuntary decisions, unless you wake up, you're like, what the hell? Yeah, just do what just happened. Where am I? How do I get home? And I think it's some point. I just keep it being that person as well, and"
"I decided that he know this guy means a lot to me. I don't want to fuck this up. Like I definitely don't want to mess it up again. Cuz I foresee ourselves have a future together. And if I take the risk again, I mean, I'm not the the crazy 18 year old that I used to be. It's just going to be the wake up tomorrow and find another boyfriend, you know, what kind of mentality right in all when you think of it as as a whole and you definitely mature in your thinking along the way as well. That couple together with couples counseling. I feel she helps because I'm for the two of us. We feel like some it's me at 10 to check on us. Fighting about the same things. You're being of the same problems. Same insecurities. We cannot lie detector ourselves away from that. So I feel like"
"It isn't that? I think it was very very helpful. And we're in a much better place now. So I think is very helpful because a lot of people ask me about it. After I now, considering doing that, even though there may not be anything immediately wrong with the relationship. It doesn't hurt to have it at Placentia. Are you going to be obese to go to a trainer? I think it's the one thing I remember is that when we join hands and because you are trying to get back, something that supposed to answer."
Is 80% of a fight. I feel is a small deal is a big deal. That way you are so hands. Are they make me a little focus in life. That's a very powerful feeling of always that religious and a legal pleasure that we going to have each others back forever until we die.
"Anything you want to meet us there after I'm not married yet. And I also wanted to know like from you. So any last words when it comes to long-term relationships, loyalty keeping the spot, going in my experience of one person. I want to see that I think loyalty takes both parties, right? And loyalty should not mean ownership of slavery. If me being loyal to the other person requires me to sacrifice a lot element of my life. Why do I want to be loyal? And I think what makes Pat and I what is that? We kind of understand that for each other."
"Yep, very nice usage."
Number one.
Note that I'm going to.
"John, thank you so much for being with us today. I mean, there's no way to buy."
"Hello, hazel. I have a zero and I'm to pay welcome back to clematis."
"Exactly right that you have lost episode about toxic masculinity. So I decided to do a little experiment 11 randomly. I just said, if it's okay, like for boys to cry and I was really surprised because you just looked at me as a yellow."
"The next generation is where we were forced to take a look at ourselves. Very seriously. We got to talk about something. I would see, very juicy. I didn't because I didn't know what kind of juice orange want to date very, very interesting because we got a very first guest on the show."
"That's right. So because I would guess it's a little bit shy, she's actually out, has producer. So we're going to use something else to represent her something cute. What do we have to get? All right, producer and pretty sketchy microphone. My name is producing. I produce patch podcast. Ye to tell you so much work goes into every episode research. A lot of details and all the producer and and her team. They're doing that as well. Thank you. And also super star super. You said, how do you feel about the episode that we're going to come out today? Are you a little bit nervous? I am actually, even though I wrote the key points down and then letting answering them will be"
"It's cool. I'm going to try because it's very personal essay. Today's topic. Yeah, that's right, because I guess a lot of people place in Boston's on wedding night. So, yeah, and it is, I guess going to be very useful for those who are looking to get married soon. I guess I'll bring curious to find out a bit more. So, let us first, we kind of like give our opinions on what you think that I do it and I should be. What would happen on your ideal wedding that? How about? Let's start with producer. Let's go, ok. Background. Could you send just a married to Wahlberg? Movies and TVs, right? I'll be very romantic, you know, it coming back from the wedding and you see your husband as your husband for the first time. Yeah. I was kind of site that I remember, I'm finally able to, like,"
"Honestly, I haven't touched you before the wedding. Do I have not have held his hands and everything like that. You got anything else?"
"I have definitely touched his hands before. OK. Google look up a bit more about your wedding. Thank, you know, you do being a hose and having hosted 20 / 330 wedding. This has really changed my ideas for wedding on the wedding night right by so far. No one has approached me to do so."
"The bitch on the day of the wedding, right? The two people who are the most high it is too bright in the room. Know anybody else. Can you imagine when you finally finish whatever you had to do for the day? You finally entertain, all your gas, you know, and then you get back to the hotel room for the energy to do anything else. Right? So this is legit dividing, my idea of a wedding night, cuddles, and breast, very realistic. I love that. Okay, before your wedding, what did you think that it was going to be? I don't think I had like thought about it. I don't think I had."
"Letting ideal or expectations. Okay, I think I was so caught up with a wedding. The preparation and stuff is yes, but I think maybe the people around me would say otherwise, but it was hell. I tell you, when I was done with the wedding. I announced to everybody wasn't a vow. It wasn't that I do so, but I think other people's ready. I'll let you do it before the wedding. I was still not done giving up my invitation, cutting it close. And I also only ordered my cake two weeks before the wedding."
"Took my order there. Still give me exactly what I wanted being as well as wedding idea. What is he hold? It would be too tired to do anything or see, I'm not looking to do anything on my wedding night that can be for the honeymoon. I want to sit in the hotel room or the room service and count my money."
"No, cuz you get to open or a smell the money, and I'll bring like a cash machine. They were just talking and we were in the hotel for a couple of days. So I can the next day. They had that it and then by the time I'm outside, can I call you? And then do like you opening it and Counting at least a cash machine? Just call me if your fingers come out."
"Use your fingers. Yeah, let me just give us the official definition of wedding night in the dictionary. What does wedding night mean producer in? It is the night of someone's wedding actual wedding today. Episode kind of came about because we were very inspired by this new Netflix series. It's called frigid. The only one who haven't seen it. I think we have all seen it but has or has not seen till the end. So let's not spoil it for me to Mario game. But to what we must make haste."
"That means we must quickly. So I will just give a little bit of a background. Okay, but what really happened. So it is kind of like if you ever seen Gossip Girl, Gossip Girl said. Ok Google, to go sit, right? They do like a flyer and use people. Okay, send it out. So it's kind of like a modern twist, very interesting. They even have string quartet covering like a grande song. Thank you, Nick. Yes, Shawn Mendes very very interesting I guess but it is reset for our younger listeners. So in this show women were very impressed, that okay. Let me know. You want to go out at night and night without a chaperone."
"On you if you want to meet anyone else at night because if you are caught like outside with a guy for example, even if you're not doing anything you like, tamed it done. And this is only applicable to women as well. Okay. So the main protagonist is Stefanie Britton. Beautiful basically send Budgetel marriage knows nothing about sex. Only knows what kissing is and over the course of the series. You see how they reblossom into a woman. So this is the spoiler. If you haven't seen episode 5, please skip pass for the next 12 minutes, but basically, in the fifth episode, Daphne, who really loves children, she got married to a do. We just like below, print a handsome, handsome?"
"Do you mean? Okay. So this dude told her he cannot have children. He cannot give her children. Okay, so she thought, oh, he's important. You know, he kind of told her she felt very bad for him. But married him out of love, even though she will really want the kids. She wanted to be a mother. That's the only thing she was sitting here. And then after the wedding night, they let me show you more. Yes. I only can show you the correct. The marital relations. Yeah. It, what do you want? Just put out the whole series of cause you did you also left a message to Asia. Yeah, which was the very perky my goodness. How much time that he's been doing squats?"
"You don't going at it like, rabbits. As you see you. I miss you realized it. How come every time that be finished but she's so cool. Has how come she knows is that? She just felt like it. How come he pull out right? Then. He she cannot satisfy him. He has to set this phone finish, himself felt like it was. So out of love. He wants to be able to do this for the guy. She wants to ya-ya. You see, because of what he didn't tell her was that he is not in front of that. He can do is just that he has made a vow before this to not have kids to not have potatoes and not Sia and are not have his bloodline continues 7. You don't have time to hit like that once event dedicated today and the Seven told her everything that happened. She realized that he had lied to her is not that he cannot have kids. He will not have kids."
"He was very choosy. I said she was very upset. So I guess this is kind of like really what happened in the past when women were oppressed. But now I feel like things have changed since then and had Daphne actually was kind of like taught by her mom or anyone in her life about the process of baby making. She would have known this unfortunate. We should didn't. So there are few things from the show that got a stinking actually even before this entire thing happened, right? One of the other family, one of the girls had gotten pregnant out of here and everybody was so curious. Like the girls were talking among themselves and it would just like but not married, how you don't understand like the entire thing. You just don't know anything about it. They believe that until you're married. You literally physically cannot have sex this, what they believe. Okay, they're conditioned to believe that by High Society. So I guess, you know, virginity before marriage as it was, then as it is now."
"It doesn't think a lot of people take very seriously for sure. Yes, and it's like a value. It's also a religious aspect of some religious aspect to it. Yeah, and for traditional families, that is the way it should be. You cannot have sex before marriage, but don't you guys think that this concept of what Unity favors the men because this new way of telling this is with regards to like the entire, like, oh, you bleed your first time, you don't bleed, your problem has something to tell us his way to text it, covered. The force that the highwomen having relations with the server name and all that. And they'll let you know. It's okay that you high."
"Terrible. The most terrible thing. But it right is that the gulf that they sleep with a completely not for marriage to that terrible, you know, because you'll go for these like opera singers and whatever else. And even if they love them, eventually marriage is out of the question because because of social hierarchy, they have to marry someone from bloodline, correct, correct. We also kind of, I guess, it is very obvious two, people who have seen the show or even people that consider your wedding night being virgins going with your wedding night and also being not virgins cuz you would have got his very different. It is, so we'll discuss more about this. But first, let's have a little bit more about Chastity season. Tell us the definition of testes, the state of not having sexual relationships on never having had sex."
"Non-sexual relationships. I had to stay away from sexual relationships and also because I, I believe in keeping it for the person that I love. Yeah, so I guess it makes it special have a friend who is a couple years older than me. She is still a virgin, right? And it's not because of religion like a producer and but it's actually because of her personal choice. She wants to lose it to someone that means a lot to like really love a relationship. I guess it's safe to say that we love this person that we are seen, but when we,"
"Things to Merritt. I think it's of a different level. Next level of trust. Why? You should have premarital sex. Yeah. Okay. So I have a friend like that. I will tell you the story in a bit. Okay. Why you should have premarital sex? Because firstly, if you're spending the rest of your life, with this person, you need to know if it works, right? It doesn't mean actual chemistry. Correct, right? I like in a be sleeping in the same bed with this bus and the rest of my life that I have fun, I guess. Okay. So sorry I did that presentation is a little people that he could have back by it. I thought it was not going to be a big deal about it in my other classes. I do. You know, she said you should have premarital sex. Oh my God."
What grade do you get off of? It is a persuasive argument. So I would cancel everything.
"What do you think? Do you think like a woman should stay a virgin until they get married? I think this is purely personal choice. I don't think there's any right or wrong because it's your body and you have the right to her to do whatever you want. But if it makes you happy, you to only give it away. After you get married, then by all means go ahead. No choice for me. I believe in opening up my options, you know, I didn't even exploring before I come to a decision to stick interesting though. I don't want to sound like"
"I don't like that, you know, but I think it is important to Sorry Ciara."
"Okay, so catching and what do mean to have a very good friend? Who has a daughter slightly younger than I am. I think couple years ago when she first got herself a boyfriend. Okay, so he told me about it and then he told me specifically as well that he told his daughter that before you get married or before you decide to marry. He believes that you should stay together first voice. And he encouraged his daughter as well. To explore the physical side of things. I will never never. Never see that."
"Okay, it's okay. Alright, he's very liberal that way and he believes in this and he was ripped open with his doctor about it, right? Case of that to stand on it. That's is taking it right for me. Right? I am bracelet. You could use an actually, okay. So I kept it till I match."
"Okay, thank you. Everybody. Was that many years ago. I had read something. Okay. Unfortunately, I don't have it with me. I can't find it. I can't find it. So no, more day 1263, but I read something and actually spoke to me because it said something about when you engage in physical activities, for example, it's not just a physical thing, but a part of your soul of a person's soul stays with you forever. How do for me? It was like, if whatever relationship you were in tons, the shit, right? That was probably something that will stay with you. Although it's out of you already, but"
"When at first you said, stay in you. I was thinking of something else. But yeah."
"And stayed with me for a long time. So with that in mind, I mean as well as you know, marriage and everything like that, so I felt like okay, I don't think, you know, if you have your heart broken, for example, that is one thing to do with her a dry. I don't think I want something like that to stay with me because it's more than just physical. We all know this, right, you know, it's extremely intimate in all sense of the word and I think when you can get you something like that, I think it's really more emotional Than Physical, right? Yeah, so I didn't want to deal with that. Okay, we will send this, to, your husband, being fairly conservative in the grand scheme of things. I would say that even though the glue,"
"Hobo kind of like mind set to what's virginity, has to be shifted butt over here in Singapore either. We'd already talked about it or a lot of families are rather traditional. So this next spot rate. I wanted to bring on both the married, ladies here in an Asura to talk a bit more about their actual wedding night. I want to hear a voice acting abilities like that exciting either. I feel that it's it's a whole new experience you have before you even step into marriage and then like for me because I've never had sex before I got married. Okay, so I guess the experience that we both share on that night. I guess we could only get it from each other not on my wedding night. Yeah."
"How come it didn't happen on the next day? It's wrong, but just from your personal experience because both of us don't have that experience a week basically step into something that we don't know what to expect. Yes. So it's just us tonight and you can just do you know how things work and what goes where? I know a lot about sex, what happens during sex. Because you is like, you know, a lot about driving for the sample. On the driver seat is a totally different story with my husband on our wedding night."
"Wedding night when you were preparing for it. Did you think like, oh, we're going to have sex? Or going to have sex? I should buy this. I should. What should I expect? What's going to happen? I do I did not ask anyone but I saw a few thoughts that talked about the wedding night. Oh, yeah. And talk from influenza who is also talked about how I didn't I experience? So it kind of got me a little bit more prepared like what to expect and when she talked about the nervousness that you might get at, you know, it's more like exploring because anything that. Before the wedding that happened that you've been doing the wedding itself, that what you mean, that you're I I was there was some woman that was thinking about you as I wish it. Like I'm going to go back and I'm going to do something totally different. That part was a little bit scary."
You guys try to make some money and didn't work out well.
"Well, okay when it happened in the morning, how is it? Was it painful, was it? I think it's more painful because you do have a foreign object, nothing for you."
Can I see the east side if I move in your finger Westside?
"It does hurt. If you would look it up when they know everyone who has sex. All this fuss time is going to her, especially for the ladies very much. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank God. It wasn't very exciting. No Festival. I've said before, on the podcast that the day before my wedding. I started beating everybody."
"Let's number one. And then number two was that it's really, really tiring. So for contacts, I didn't go and leave before I got married. So I can Marathon today. Friday is the only day that I was on leave and the very next Monday. I was back at work."
"And this woman hit like the house, Singapore. And it was, how many people I had over 2,000? Guess a lot of people get times when people get time and it basically rain from 10 a.m. To 8 p.m. I have four outfit changes. I was just a bit by the end of it, right? It was just the end of it. By the time was on my second outfit which was at like 1 p.m. I was done. Yes, but that was it for me. So I'm going to wedding we and our closest friends went to hang out and then we went back to the room."
"I tell you, I we didn't even get to look at like post that people tagged Us in we didn't even look at pictures. It was immediately wanted a good night. See you tomorrow. Love you knocked out well done. So when did you guys and gate latch in the relations? What happened the next morning? When did it happen? Maybe two days after that? Yeah, I think for me, I am quite comfortable, like, with people in general and things like that, you know, so it wasn't awkward for me. I would imagine maybe for some goals. For example, that would be like embarrassed maybe or like a picture. Yeah, and things like that but because of how I am right stuff, okay, to natural process. Okay? Okay, like I kept it to your wedding night or day for this matter. What about your husband?"
"Tell you, about case go right with this with one because okay. I for a while. I used to always be like, I wish she had experienced a hot brick before me, then you will know why, you know, but that we all just felt like that was certain things. That maybe he didn't fully understand all that fully grasp. Right? Because you never went through that heartbreak. So that's why I thought one day A friend told me like a I think you cannot think this way anymore. I think you need to think about it in such a way that you are one of the very few in the world, right? Who can go to sleep every day knowing and being a short that you have his heart and no one else has hasn't had it left. I think it's very special to take comfort in that and let go of my"
"Turkey's insecurities. But like if you had gone through this, you would know how to Value this a little bit more. That was my initial idea. What? Yeah. I hope you're all still friends with him. But let me ask you guys. Have you ever heard of something called the high middle? Plasti? You do something to put it back yet? Oh my God. If you are not a virgin before marriage and In some cultures believe that you have to bleed on your wedding night, you'll have, it has to be broken on your wedding night. So what they do is they reconstruct the highwomen or translate hyperbole to you. So that it is closed up again and your husband can break through it. There is also a vaginal reconstruction vaginal beautification. But let me ask you guys is hush listeners. Are there such thing for guys, just a good question. Question pretty sad because I didn't I didn't"
Many ways will hymen to be broken. You could have literally been like on a bicycle pump.
"Location of riding a bicycle on the bus guy, is closest to ride a bicycle in the air and had to get five stitches, official location with people break through its strength and my mother was and then go to the cardboard back and all the sudden now."
"So, I decided to cycle myself and then I filled it a dream."
"And then I go cut like below my eye all the way down because he no no spots. But if I cry very badly, I think it's see a bit of like we're talking about this because In some cultures or in some societies, women feel like they have to lie that they're virgin in order to preserve, you know, their purity. And how does society view stem? Does this mean that this relationship is not as strong, as you think it is? They say no, no lies in the relationship that you have fully trust the other party, but I think he he did every night."
"BB playing with Woods or risky, wish that he would just open up the volume level and tell her about this entire episode of his father, but I also understand that it must have been very hot. It was an 18in. Do you know any people in person Kush & Orange? What do we think about people lying about their virginity? Right? I feel like you understand where the women is coming from because how Society see other people who are still traditional and conservative women, who are not budging on the night of the wedding, the wedding project."
"Let's see if she did tell the truth and then she might get in trouble, not just for lying to a husband. She might get in trouble, you know from, I Didn't Know doing things that her parents told her not to do for something. Let me know. I think it's very much depends on the community that you are raised in and sometimes you just don't want to be the object of Scandal. Do you know? You have to protect yourself and don't want to see whistledown to write about. You share some funny stories when I saw the first one in producer."
"This one night. I couldn't relate to. Okay, so just passed and I'm ready to say, is I remember having to remove Teddy eat bobby pins from my wife, had to take her clothes off. I'm not the best app for flea, and another commented to that come in. And he said, he ate, I stopped counting after 180, but it's truly, imagine the wedding hairstyles, you know, a video of bobby pins. And I've never once what bobby pins in my life, every sure I come back with the second comment, didn't happen that night. Putting on the wedding was sold winning that we went to sleep right away, but after that the first few times, we talked with, we just have to learn how to do."
"What was, or what was in working for us? Only the first sentence related to me today?"
"A lot of couples. It doesn't happen on the wedding night. So don't stress and depression. Enjoy yourself. We relate to. Okay, so friend of mine from school. That's a story from Reddit wait until the wedding night. They were very religious. Religion concerned. So, he was a responsible guy, right? He used a condom on the wedding night shortly after he started experiencing some sinsations. Not the good kind down there. Yeah, like burning. And tingling and all that. As she was rushed to the, ER, emergency room, and he found out, he has a latex allergy on his wedding night. Oh, my gosh, he must have thought something was wrong at. What is it burning, right?"
"On the flip side, right? Couples that experience with engage in sexual relations before the wedding that I think they have a completely different expectations for the wedding night. Because it's not like we're waiting to do this. This is the me. So, okay, for anyone get onto this. What do you think would be the difference Prix in Austin match. Do you think I would be a difference if you have sex before marriage, but sure. Don't be different because you wouldn't be nervous or scared. It's something that you've done a billion times. You have already communicating like the sex itself like before. And after do you think that would be a difference before marriage? You are a biscuit apprehensive cuz you might be knocked up, right? Especially if you don't use protection, which you should use protection. Allen Chevrolet technology, but you can find other forms of election, correct, then I think maybe after it. It's a bit more like"
"She was a bit expensive or wedding night. I feel like you wouldn't have fit or or if you're looking to have kids, you know, you maybe even hopeful and that's nice feeling you wouldn't be scared. You just did whatever. Because even if you're not ready to go, but if it happens, it's okay, cuz you're married. And you know, this was a one-night stands. Is that right? Ok, Google, logout. The wedding night. Honestly, for someone that's not married yet. It is giving me a lot of perspective. I would you say if you like it, put a ring on it."
"So, I wanted to wrap this up with some of our personal thoughts. Okay? Okay. I think I can, I can stop for a plus and foremost don't stress. If it doesn't happen in your wedding night and when it does happen get free after whenever it is the first time is never going to be good. You guys don't know what is happening and it's not fussing with the time in general. What goes where, you know, what you're supposed to do? And you haven't communicated on know this person. Well enough to enjoy it as much as you should write. But if this is your person, you should be able to communicate with them about your wants, and your needs and kind of gradually not be shy about it. For sure, for me is more, like, if you are not like you are not a virgin on your wedding night. Don't be stressed out over it as well. Like what you mean? See it. I'm sure there's someone's whatever you want as long as you are truthful and you communicate to your other half. I think everything will work out very well."
"Do you even have a better time because your experience, you know what I mean? I think expectations. No disappointments to understand that it's a process. You don't decide to be stressed about if you're going to marry this lesson, you know, it's lifelong. I right so it's you know, something that you can explore together and communicate openly lightest of You by Shai, you know, like they don't know how to talk about it. But I think we all know that like physical relations. Yes, is that important aspect of marriage as well and fitness nothing to talk about it that you don't respect what you want. Okay, but also right before we end off, I actually went to touching something is all cuz I just thought of it right. I want to ask you. Let's say you've had multiple partners. Okay. Okay, would you lie about it? This is not about whether a virgin or not, but"
To lie about your number.
"No, no. No, I wouldn't I will be absolutely honest and truthful. What is a lie about? I mean if you find that this is something not acceptable, then it's fine. We can go our own ways. I'm fully okay with it, right? But what if your count is rather high and it's not something you're proud of, and you really like this person, if I have done it, I would own it. I would be responsible for my actions. Even if the count is high. It's me who made this decision so that there's no use being ashamed of it. Now. What do you want to be with someone who would judge you for your body count, right? That's what I think you made a commitment to this bus. And then, you know, I'm not going to sleep around like I'm committing myself to you, but that should be enough for a I guess in a sense. I have a friend. I'm okay. She believes a different thing is he so she thinks that"
"Saving it or your first time or that this is secret is overrated thinks that it's been emphasized so much. You don't like, it's important. It's important. It's a secret. What you think? It's absolutely ridiculous. And it doesn't make sense because she feels like, you know, once you start having it right, it's just a physical thing. That's what she believes. You see. And she's very okay with seeing and making it clear that I don't want anyting. I'm just here for this. Okay. Okay, call me. I think it's hot and barely question about my body. If I let you in then that means a lot to me like that for her, right? And so she's carried on that way, but at some point brother around now, because it's been a couple years since the last relationship. So she feels like, I don't even know how to date anymore. And if I do, I've been sleeping around"
"It's been so nothing to me that she feels like she is not good enough for somebody. That is over the let it be because that constitute to who you are today, correct? Everyone is different a different believe when it comes to marriage to sex. So just you know be confident in who you are really care about people's judgment on the day. So I kind of wanted to wrap it up with some advice for people. Listening. We're not married yet. Let's go to our two. Beautiful ladies here for you, sir. Edward's wedding night advice. Do you have like what she"
"I just might want to send slavicek. Yeah, because it says shop of lead."
"All right. So advise for girls who are doing it for the first time on your wedding night. I think everything you do is going to be scary like everything, anything you so don't be nervous about it earlier. Germain and Azeroth talked about expectations don't have any expectations because to avoid disappointment don't have expectations. And also like I stated earlier that there will be order might be feel tense and that is totally normal. So focus on intimacy, get to know each other and get comfortable if it doesn't happened. The first night, there are so many more nights or days. I'm wet. It can happen. And a very, very important thing to note is that marriage is more than just sex. I think it's as much an emotional as it is physical. I don't think you should be too nervous or pay too much attention to let your laundry for example, cuz I think"
"He won't even know if this one in, like, 2 minutes. S s, I think I would be able to be in comfortable with me. Right? It's because I love my dessert. So I make sure that my wedding that it was going to be a desert, the Lola. Okay, so I had a separate and I think we had a selection of like sucky desert."
"And a life. True station and a life ice cream and everybody said the same code, and I'm just like anyting for your wedding. You're just you to see if one from each ready. If the dean is it just one last question. What about finding out about sex before your wedding night? If you have not had sex before then, I think maybe if you know, people who you can talk to who is married who can tell you like things that you need to know. I think yes, I think it's absolutely okay to ask shouldn't be here like ashamed of, you know, I think it's normal. We should normalize talking about this."
"Definition mom from Bridgeton to do anything but I won't want to be dishonest with my kids and future at what age do you think you will stop talking about it? 1616 maybe. Yeah, what about you sent about sex in school? More than I need to know about sex on the day of your marriage, but I feel like I'm what I seriously, don't be afraid to ask questions because I know for sure that I am afraid to ask that question and I do regret not asking it and I was hoping you flat say, if somebody is asking me, I just wished. I'm brave enough to answer them because yeah, like what has happened to Tila."
"Is yes. And with it? Thank you very much for doing again. So we hope that this episode has been educational for you and that you have learned a thing or two and also here would like to wish you a happy with that, maybe taking a little break and celebrate CNY, you know, to spend some time for family and loved ones.

So I watch my own and I'll bring it back to my parents home to wash it. I think what she did is right. I would never want my mother-in-law. Sometimes called a laser."

"Hello, and welcome to another episode of Men. Explain is sunny here with you. Thank you so much for all the support and the love so far, has been so much fun. I've been learning so much about the men's perspective. Today's guest, is someone that I've never actually sat down to have a conversation like this, with before, and also, he is a sight for sore eyes, please welcome. I am. I do, I do for myself as well. Sometimes I feel for printing stuff and I'm starting to write, and hopefully, I'll be directing one day. And, you know what, today's topic is interesting, cuz we are about to address why men are most men. If you not, you, but most feel the need to suppress the emotions. So, you know, Tom's eye or grow a pair or like, oh, Manna or you're not manly enough of these accounts that are showing around quite a bit, right? So you want to explore how toxic masculinity"
"Impacts. Our society. Is this going to be a stressful one for you? Are you cool like chatting with me? I think it's fine. I think it's something that is very important to me. I respect women. So there was always a disparity in how I felt growing up and then I go out into the world and I have all these expectations and I'm like, huh? Ok, and even from within the family and the ones who have raised me to be who I am. And do you feel like generally, you're the kind of person that's very in touch with your feelings. I think I've always been very in touch my feelings. I'm a very emotional person growing up. I used to always cry easily at movies and I still cry easily get moving. So, the whole cohort went to watch Bridge to Terabithia and I was crying and every I can feel it."
"What is going on? Only one of the bunch of wusses Sydney. Ya episode. We are also looking at how Society has, you know, brought us up as such, you know with certain perceptions and and how maybe you as a man as well. You feel like when you were younger perhaps you had to conform to certain ideas or like certain ways that people see men as so what are some moments in in your life when you feel like okay. I cannot feel my feelings aside from the movies or do I have to restrain myself or be more manly or like or some balls, you know stuff like that, especially growing up when it and it's not even to strangers or people ain't right. Sometimes. It's to your own closest friends. You don't. You want to fit in? I think back then everyone wants to"
"That's easy to gang up on them to make themselves feel better because it branches into kg. Right. You want to ban together in the easiest way to do that is to you know, make someone else, your pocket is really unhealthy and just not being not a good thing for anyone to do that recently about two years ago. I would have to drive. So it's my birthday and I got so many people green light Auto. You seen Singapore? Like I'm like, okay. Yeah. I think that you raised up in general. I feel like men are expected to drive. Well, you're expected."
"I have a natural Flair for it to be able to instantly Holmes, lawn gnomes, right? I think the decent driver, but something natural day-to-day life. I think is a good time. To also property to find what toxic masculinity is because all these examples are some examples of flies by the radar. We don't even realize that this is toxic behaviour or toxic masculinity. Suppressing emotions are hiding the stress that aggression, as an indication of power, all classic examples here and sometimes you just don't even realize it in this industry and you've been in this industry for for a couple of years. Now, for some time now, right. Do you feel like it"
"Putting time you need it to conform to the idea of being a very masculine man. Anyway. Anyway, you go, you know, you kind of want to do Beach. I meet the guy is right and you know, sometimes you hear baby's like casual sex sister about being tossed around and just like, okay, I wouldn't call this guy out because you don't want to energy unsick in school or anything. Everyone just wants to to be secure. And so naturally like if you don't want to confirm your yourself and who you really are and your emotions and all that, easiest way to do it is to be the most superficial need match with the sporty. Do you know who to look at? The guy? Who's good at math? And that's a real man."
"Go to feel like one is to at least be more different than a woman which is in your physical appearance. It was right because you only people who are more athletic more, masculine more deemed worthy or attractive. A Norman Manley answer that naturally just began if you like maybe I should be like that. Maybe it's just what I need to do to gain the attention of the opposite sex or something. I was just sharing with some the team owner on that cuz you asking me also about my take on it. Since, you know, obviously I've had a history of boyfriend and I realize that all almost all my ex-boyfriend's a very different. Like there's not one I all, I all of them, I must get all the types of of man, you know, as well. And I thought to myself like did I or do I look out for masculine good-looking guy? Not necessarily, I mean,"
"Saudi, right. I think what matters more is if a guy is confident in your own skin, you're confident, you're healthy. You know what you're doing. It doesn't bother you. If you're standing next to like an ultra Booth guy or something. I don't know what to say. Is that a guy thing? Like, I'm not going to stand next to someone that still buff and figure like moves, like to go to the gym, the ones who will look after them, that their dead bodies. And you want to stop this muscle. Muscle and watch everything. I eat there. Actually, one of the most insecure maybe decided to go to the gym because of that, I think ultimately if you're putting so much effort to look this way and then along comes another guy who you deem looks better and you use like you want to be the best but this is other guy, but you can also let me know if Jack guys who are very confident, but I don't think that confidence lies solely in your physical appearance. I think it's"
"As in your own confidence that may come from working in your body, in circular creatures. And you know the girls, okay. I am sure that you're watching right now. You might agree with always like my skin sucks or like I need to lighten lose 4, kg or like like to do, you know, it's true about this amongst ourselves. And then we also rely on each other to uplift each other. This is true. This is what we do. I put stories about the female bathroom in clouds, right? And everyone gets along, but a meal. Bathroom is not like that."
The mailbox room just curious cuz we can spend like 30 minutes in their pre-pandemic.
My sister needs help.
"You like chopped off the top of my legs, a little grunts, honey. You will be surprised the bathroom in the club's, not the best place to be for them to be very defensive posture during this a lot. Like, you know, like every everyone wants to feel good about themselves because we kind of person next to us. So even in the in, the bathroom is love life bravado."
"That you kind of feel like okay. I got to be a bit defensive feel like we should just the way that you view masculinity as well as you grew up. I think so there was never any clearer than conscious like, this is what it is to be a man or something, but maybe that's why I'm a bit more emotionally in tune with my emotions yet is a very mansmann. So what happened was, I would feel like the way I feel like I'm very emotional and very Monty's. Call me a snag. Yes. I'm a snake snake. Is this new guy feel this way? Maybe it's because of my upbringing and then I have the guys who are, you know, everyone's trying to be"
"Different way, uniform, same haircut, So if it was very jarring resident at looking at TV shows on my, oh, maybe I should try to fulfill the roles and stereotypes right of what it is to be a man feel better about myself, but deep down. I never really felt citizen pop culture. You see this out in the world, especially when you're young and trying to find your place and find who you are. I think over time I just got very comfortable with. You know, what? I'm not. Happy China Post. You ain't trying to be something. I'm not because it's not. Sustainable is just very after. I was like, oh my gosh, you have to live for and ask the other day. Family member pointed out that I was wearing a lot of bracelets and stuff. I think it is a generational thing."
"I was, I was shocked to know, should I change with the generations? I think the younger generation is very aware of these things are very vocal about it. So that's very good. Always come from the older Generations, who pass on this knowledge, to the new generation in every generation. You still have those people subscribing to the old lawn, put in the work to understand these things so that you can always say that. But if he did know what's really going on here, did the age sit down and figure themselves out, of course, you know, so the new just projecting is all just projections."
"Just seemed obvious to me that you had a past job experience as a relationships. Like, has it ever been a topic way. I was brought up in an argument or, you know, that topic of masculinity has ever come up before? No. No, I don't think I would that come up here since when it comes to relationships and I owe, you know, I need my boyfriend, for example, to be more of a man that I need him to let it charge. I need him to come pick me up or take lunch or you know, I need him to support me more financially in the future. I need to know that I'm secure stuff like that. But I know it's a friend as well who is very frustrated that her boyfriend doesn't want to come."
"I'm not sure if this was part of any sort of, you know, memories or you know experiences that you had before, do you feel pressured to be loyal guy? I need to call you to buy the house. I need to do it is to live in fear for been done on the way to work in the cab with the conduit of driving. So no, I think the concept of dating in this day and age has changed a lot already, right? Exactly. So I mean, so I guess I will share a story one of my one of the first guy that I ever dated. Okay. This was back then when I was doing Polly and he was so I told him you so he had to go to an S&M memories."
"Surprised. And you can be sure of yourself posing me out there. But I feel like, during that time. I was still very young didn't have much experience in relationships. Like, I didn't even know how to date or whatever. Like I'm a girl school at 10 years of my life. Didn't know how to dress, to know how to make up, whatever. Heck. I don't know anything until probably like totally Blank Slate. Had no idea what's going on. So when the guy that I was doing back then had to go into an ass. I was thinking of, how hard could it be? I can still see him on the weekends, you know, it's going to be all good and all that. But what I did not realize was that he was going through a lot during this. Especially what is it called? Where they have to stay in a very limited amount of time with them and he was going through a lot internally and struggling with, you know, I guess being there and being stuck their activities. And just so, you know, it took a toll on his psychological Health too, and he never really wanted to open up to me about it because he's always at. Yeah, I got it. And it is cool."
"You always want to plan, you know, dates and stuff like that on all the weekend, and I appreciate it. But I felt like I didn't ask him about his feelings and nothing. He didn't also want to open up to me enough about what he was going through and eventually, it imploded, because he spiraled down into bit of depression as well. And he acted out in, in some ways and in families had to get involved. Because, you know what, I mean, if you're watching is now like, no, not going to name names but I felt bad because I think as a partner and I wasn't also having these conversations with him or having enough of these conversations and perhaps we were younger, you know, how to do is send things are interesting things. I felt like I could have been a better go friend for him to lean on emotionally. Ultimately. We always with us we don't know how it like the exes, right? So we can always just think that but it's just, you know, it's it's"
"So, how was your time? There was a lot of the more, the more you come across a variety of ways is not just like muscles and you don't brute force and whatever it could be intellect of Greek soldiers as well. Maybe not in the most obvious, but they have other qualities that made a good soldier, but that isn't easily recognized that this situation could at least meet me. Don't have enough of that. Before you judge someone, I saw, I saw a lot of people who are very small, but those dudes can last in the field. They can just keep fighting and carry."
"Heavy loads psychological strength, is that your mind is powerful. It is a kind of Happiness over my belly hits, I scratch. So this is immediate and obvious. This whole perception is changing along the way. Do you think, you know, guys in and even you opening up about you going for your your life quote? Sure, therapy and stuff. Like that, that you have a life coach do all open to therapy because men are there still see or perceived RV in counseling as something of a witness, you know, how can I let me know? I think that's a good. I think that would the rise of feminism as well and it really helps the female bathroom."
"I'm very good at getting help and advice even from other men, even from their own friends. I agree with that and I would always get the advice and opinions and what they're doing and how you know, how they're doing it and try to learn from from out there doing but"
"You going to do now? It's not very easy to sit down and go guys. I'm going through that. I need some help. Yeah, it's okay for me. I'm a bit more open and I know a lot of guys would rather just like handle themselves and I don't really know where that comes from or why it may be because the have to believe that no matter what my friends say, It's my life. And then these are my experience. Is it my fault that this is why I'm so there's no point looking elsewhere and I will try to look into it, which is not a bad way of looking at it. But I think that I think your judgment is clouded by your own, this bias your neck. Yeah, you anymore. Since when you're very close Avenue to release,"
"That's a really good way of approaching things. We've covered quite a wide variety of examples. Wrap it up with this question for you. Why do you think masculinity is so important to most men? And is this something that needs to change? People find it easier to fall into norms and rules in a a long time. It's easier to do that and go like, this is what it means. It's a very technical answer. I'm going to do this, do this, do that, who I am and be okay with Integrity is doing the right thing, even in the face of adversity."
"I know. And, you know, I asked you like the idea and I guess, in a way when you are looking for the ideal partner or in my case. I do mad and all that, right? I think he is not so much of like, how well you take care of your physique. And what is, how do you take care of me? As a partner? Are you considerate? Are you conscientious? You know, are you also someone who wants to keep your mental and physical health in check? I think that's also important taking care of yourself. And then in turn taking care of your partner, is one is doing good. And so it is that knowledge Norm, because it's the norm not questioning it, and changing yourself to suit is Norm suppressing yourself or trying to be something you're not."
"Play high N, Dry depression. Rates are very high. And there's a reason for that because I feel like women are loved more than anything to do is the man's rule. 22 just say I got. This must have been a boy at all. No, I I totally agree. So, I think to wrap this up nicely, you know, it is important for you to be in touch with your emotions, your feelings to also realize that it's okay to ask for help. It doesn't matter if your guy grow, whatever it doesn't matter. I think it's just too important to do some introspection, the reflection as well, and realize that it's okay to even go for therapy. I think that's something that is such a big conversation. Ariana Grande is doing that to me. $10 worth of your feelings, in your problem, in a friend's son, has to be vulnerable."
"That takes courage. I mean, I don't know what you guys but I feel like he has a very masculine. Thank you, baby. This is an interesting first meet poppy. You know, you was that"

Who the hell was Levi and Grace cool like that? So it's it's me really confused. And then are we reconnected from there on? And she did not like that?
"And then she brought me on photoshoot. So I helped her out and stuff like that. And then she stopped at the light, pull me into the whole hobby, all together and I've been thoroughly poisoned ever since, I guess, being a goal. It is a very interesting intrinsic part where you want to like,"
"Dress up. Yeah, it's like like hell case. Everybody is like to dress up as Elsa. Like, essentially, we all have that one that we won't go out of my way to do it. Like teen though, as adults as we grow past the face. It's a childish of you, anything. It's a very good creative outlet. And when I was introduced to the Hobby, right, it didn't didn't bring out like a very chili essence of me. And I I really enjoy that pot. Yeah, like changing everyone. Like sometimes you just want to post in another form of life in a different reality because it does help with your imagination. How did you get hobby into a career that could mention."
"Yeah, what does it what does it mean? When my content it was actually true of one of my friends who came up with me and sit, I have a booth at this event called OG Melo and I have an extra space. Would you like to check out that space like cells of a costly Prince on my face like one or two people? So I sold my first and surprisingly, it's sold out. Okay. I was an autograph and picture from then on I started like losing more often when you behave, then sometimes that people don't talk to you like that. So it's good to keep an open mind and soul when the reputation of events to come and approach you, and ask you, would you like to"
"Guest at my Nick convention usually comes about a guest appearance together with like you can sign merchandise and then you get like, sometimes like if I go to an event and they're like, oh sorry to vent, so we don't get out of here and see, I don't really mind the hotel, the flight. Everything's covered Philippines. Hong Kong."
"I miss Uncle. I've also been to LAX America Sydney smash. I go to UPS at KL a lot. I went to jail once a month for like 6 months. So I think my high has recalled at 1 would be $7,000 a month, but the lowest I can go down to like that was probably also due to covid. Yeah, that was when he like what happened. I was stuck in the account and then I posted my Sakura cosplay from now."
Like some Dental in like every single month. I got at least a thousand followers.
Just let you know when you're presenting an opportunity. And then I ask myself like
"But I want to do it now because if I try to do it late, I might all the opportunity won't call again and turned it on the site. Unfortunately. I'm not a good multi-tasker. I got a lot of invaluable experience has been my best friends and anywhere I go in the world. I have a friend who I can be none, that kind of feeling."
"Very you remove from The Real World. It's insane conventions. Like a fa the cues can go out to the morning queue for The Rush in to go and buy merchandise, can be up to three to four hours long the entry. We have yearly any song concert also and the concerts to Bringing quite the crowd watching anime. I think majority of people watching me."
"And me being involves, right? Let's be like following tree. That's falling voice, actors falling vtubers and cost us."
"Is quite a significant amount. I guess we could live off an industry. Like this shows that there is a demand for it like like compared to American Circles of American content of Motor Vehicles, in general. I have multiple people like that. But usually they are just awkward very kind-hearted people and we talked to them and"
"I lost friends out of this actually, like when they open up to you and then they discover this community. And then from then on depending on highly depending on who you hang out with phones, the way you interact with people and I'm very lucky to have met."
"Like sensible people in the community, so it's not as delusional."
"Brighton, cellular."
"I seem like a Chinese girl, or I think I actually was going by make out with someone, right? And then I was at Avenue K, the one-time thing because I think it's just the way people behave, like, like, that is a sucker for love. Like, no Venusaur anxiety when the way they interact with other people. That that fits the stereotype."
But not everyone acts like that.
"Laugh about these kind of the preconceived notion that they might make you feel uncomfortable. Hurt you. I also do have it depending on my mood or how they approached me in the situation, but mostly I just try to keep it open. So"
"Friends from just. Keep an open line is like amazing light light point of view and thoughts and then you can discuss with them about different things, like politics stuff like that. So yeah, that's that's why I love about you can't open right now."
Never mind.
"I'd be all right if I wasn't around with someone who is different from my culture. That's a question about so I still don't understand why you were so, you know, I did something that you just be patient."
"Yeah, that's just a reason and type of Storytelling is like big titties like sure that that exists but what anime and is a medium? Yeah, so that is"
"But you look at American, talk to an adult cartoons. And then there is like, like Family Guy, The Simpsons, and then this stuff like that. And it is also YouTube's kids who has production site, Ruby RWBY. So, and so, that is a medium and animes like a medium like that. They have psychological anime there for enemy and"

A thing that everyone does it because that is the one that gets the most attention in mainstream media. Like it's like a very interesting fact.
"But you do like I do also the coffee and if you want to focus on the NSFW portion ready to make that phone then so be it sex pills, which is also a reason why I want the smaller creatures in the community cuz I do love you as much as I do flight. Why people with"
Associate light coffee with one.
"Some of the most popular. Yeah. Yeah, and it's literally like when you go and act like it was everything that days, Yeah, and then Texas itself already. So sexualized, it's so many mediums like unlike buckets of money, which is like not true because even if you do like that day, I said my eyes any more $7,000 right? In that month, right?"

"Determine I think, why do I find out, which is popular during the. Of the animated? I want to catch up on that. I wash it when I went by the time. We just suck right now and"
"After which, I usually will find like one or two characters that are really like from the series. My favorite, every single character in that series. I like to find myself. We didn't that character and it makes it makes the cost me if you want any. When I don't know. Like, some people cost me things that much because of the estate, which is completely fine, but I don't see the business deal for me. If I do that, like, you don't see that. It's just I just feel like a coat hanger. So when you do photoshoots, right? And everything, yeah."
Would taking a short break.
"Play the podcast Too, Deep by dvsn on Spotify."
"Singapore, Writers Festival. This year is intimacy."
"If you have a short story a poem or love note, exploring the meaning of each messaging you and would like a chance to be featured on a podcast by your Instagram. Email and Nicole is anonymous and she's are welcome to and she's so close this Saturday 19th of September at 2359 hours is Pacific Time. Now back to the episode."
"My impression is that like coffee and giving initiative, goes like yeah, I mean, I mean like a medium. Well, yeah, so I have characters like"
"At night on a mobile games, fgo Fate Stay Grand order, and it's kind of fun to just go and drink sometimes at night, football, stand people. Like, what the hell is she doing covid NYC? I so have fun fun games to play with friends that Co-op James or I can just do a, i r l swing by to see about camera and I hang out with my depression is actually like you to think about. You think about it. Like, typically woman Industries will be like, I don't know, but actually, in fact, there's so many male doctors in the dining area."
"What would you think would be a woman dominate? The industry like right off of it, maybe but was like, but like James Charles coming on the boat and drag queen and many. Where is, where is there a place we can clean us out on. Even in class. I have milk on a swap said that is because we can go to any other of you. You will be popular something quite a lot of female cosplay as effing. Hot Wheels, America talked about about having a very sadness, baseball for cosplay."
"Automatically registered, light coffee castlight, Health Centric. So we have to make hunting cater to male audiences for females."
"Yeah, they have a pretty hot off and he's even though it's not as big as as the male audience. Like I will consider everywhere. I go buy some milk. Milled navigate in the male-dominated industry."
I like.
"What is the stereo tired of dealing? With my very first, which dream, I was a collaboration with OverWatch and the featured me on there, at the approach me for the anniversary Hammond. So I tried it and I never, I've never stream twitch streams what back then? And I didn't know that I needed moderate does. I didn't know that like, how to run a stream. I don't know how to say. I stream it from my, oh my God immacula. It was insane. This will be my first time fuming and he wanted to buy help me setup my patient site."
Running.
"But I think I didn't get enough time my spirits to to run the full stream and I got like a negative feedback, like my own costume at night, why I liked by the characters that cost with you, but they want the ship it to promoting like that the new character, but obviously, I'm not a Pro Gamer. I'm not like boats to be a good game about then until now and the other responses were like there was a few handful of people in the chat going like why is this email on the front of the desert page when she can't even pay properly? Like when she doing here? I kind of thing and there was a hundreds of inter comment on my chat and I had no battery does the Venom whatsoever."
"I would like to go like I'm working so hot as a streamer. I don't get want to do views and you get you get a page that kind of shit, Fuck. Yeah, so that was kind of crazy. It kind of like I realized that I was getting a lot of hate. When my friends call me on my phone cuz I do any careful to chat but there was 7,000 people watching you, do people supposed to exchange rate? Usually got like four people watching hockey. With that has 7,000 people watching me and I had no fucking mother Rita's."
"All my friends were also watching and they were like, defending me in the chair with a, very thankful for. All right, but I just said, if he doesn't come you, so that light, the people who engaged you threw, you under the bus, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was annoying you that people didn't like the fact that I'll be there in like 2 minutes."
"But even when I, when I stop saying, I said something about Michael Strahan stuff like he didn't respond well to a email talking about how they like the game. I don't like people will come on and defend, Lexie, and response yet."
"Yeah, it's a whole new, only men argument, but when they go outside like when women go all the way to do it, they still get Sean for it. It's not all men. But all women experience it."
Every single one of my experience harassment.
"Go to. I do have my first day off in Congress within cells by what is a the people that support me and sells because I talked to activism related stuff an insults, usually one stomach that kind of shit. I'm very glad that because I'm outspoken about things like that. I tend to stay away or I tend to not attract people who I like of that kind and like, my followers have a working brain, which is something. I'm very proud of like building a iPhone about you boss when I was at my home Netflix, as we got sensor and my Netflix, right? If you ask me something and then you type in the court,"
"But you wish you had like nothing. So do the search for like, what my America's friends like watch that will likely couldn't find it."
"Oh, thanks, like a few hundreds of of different series of movies with Netflix for the Singaporean region. Most censored version of Netflix ever."
"adjusting my schedule, but we also"
tell me a video about about about dead and I guess it's just
"like, some people say it, if you have a pet Farm where"
"Like, people are struggling to get there and you already there."
And me and the triangle.
"like to be useful for once, you know, like,"
"Yeah, and personally, as well as a minority myself as a lgbtq. I've always been posting about."
"Different things like that Saturday, but I've never actually, I do like Ignacio."
"and to think I was supposed to the private was mine, and I'm like"
"When is it came out if I owe you? But the moment I stop pointing out the problems within like like about the sunniest, like, she's like being way too outspoken. And all right, if you release two in solidarity with with us, like ways with, I don't see. Why is everyone? So obviously I do have quite a lot of followers. Like, respect. All I got consumed whatever I post and they genuinely want to get educated. And every day when you post stuff like that. I feel like I'm learning something new. I'll take off my own bottle as like a Singaporean Chinese person. Cuz a lot of people that called me asking about Chinese people."
"Chinese. And when when you bring people out of these Bubbles and went to an open mind, they don't see us and a text like that, you don't like when when they see it that way there. Like, holy shit. I really come from a crazy beliefs of religion and night people live."
"Such different lives from me, you know. Yeah, I think I think it's just something you can see a few questions for you and holding you reconciled in me."
"Very Whitney Texas. G's eating right and I feel that you are on lunch, sitting out for the things that you can use some of which to come in conflict with the things that like people who are in the community."
"As a bisexual myself, I enjoy titties. I enjoy very good shit, right? Yeah. I do see that. It's not always necessary on all that phones. Like, sometimes it's just I I recently I love the game like like it was a game about like boats and game forecast too much on light light. I don't know ask up to use and I was just so unattractive to me. Is it really that necessary to 210 service, a sellout, this entire game, just so meals will cash more money into the game. And it, so I stop playing the game by super characters."
Do you like?
"Objective content, like I will call it objectivity subjective. I think they are trying to find woman's heart is nice to look at online, right? Then I realize that"
"This is just trying to get cash pawn, it at this point and I just stopped supporting it."
"You're not when every character has a high level is Manny sent and it's just not focusing on the game anymore. It's not about the content anymore. Yeah, it is still a very heavy sexist industry because characters like overly sexualized."
"I feel bad cuz I enjoy it. I know I shouldn't continue to be this sick. I don't have the autonomy to do I think decisions like that cuz I'm still a small Creator. Yeah. So what I do is at because I'm not an NSFW costly, I tend to cause we stopped and not. Usually I do coffee like like bikini summer release at hospice in an order to the heavy sexualized, light on the ice."

"Welcome back to something private, a podcast of Southeast Asian women, by Southeast, Asian women, exploring conversations, around Health, the South community and love. My name is Nicole, and I am your producer and host."
"The last episode of Season 4 and we got a really special one on all the amazing women that we featured on a platform so far, is Asia to take care of their own reproductive Health to Malaysian celebrity. Chef is using a platform to share about the struggles living with endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome. And what kind of realize that my love to my second from the first years serving as an opposition MP. What it's like talking politics with barely any prior experience on being a representative for minority versus how she coped with the investigations over a year ago, for online comments about race and religion."
"In a present examination, in bringing up more controversial issues of sexuality, education, in Parliament, for your generosity to share something private about this. I love young adult fiction."
"Yeah, and I still read it to this day and I'd love like chick has recently. I've really been into like dragons and magic and kind of delving into like those types of world. I think, the first kind of young adults like, magic key fiction that I read was are gone. So the whole inheritance series I even recently, just kind of finished all the books again. Okay, just kind of relaxing for me, but then I think, like, if you want to can upgrade from that, I love wise man's fear, by Patrick rothfuss."
I really like 20 years younger than you and yet you still love me.
"You are currently now. I'm the youngest surviving Member of Parliament in Singapore. At the age of 27. He's been a year since you entered has happened since then. If you want to ask us a journey, I think and it's been full of ups and downs."
"But I'm really grateful that I've had a really incredible team around me. So I think we've built a really great group of people serving residents in compassvale. I know. So, of course, I'm assisting me in in different things, but it's definitely been a year full of growth. I've learned a lot. And I'm, I'm definitely going to keep letting tell me a bit about Georgie entering politics for about a year-and-a-half before I supposed to run as a candidate before. I never really saw myself as entering politics. I always thought I would kind of stick with the air that I know, which is in activism and Civil Society. Basically, what I love the most is running programs and projects the communities, so I never really saw myself as a"
"Just barely even a politician and even now I don't, but it's still kind of shocks me that, you know, this is the title that I have. My journey hasn't been linear. I think it's never been my goal to be a member of parliament. But, of course, now that I am, I take it really seriously and, and I'm really grateful for the opportunity. You know, you are approaching. You would like. Okay, like, this is something that I would seriously consider with my husband and my family, he was really supportive and my husband is all. He was like, you know, this is a really great opportunity to include your voice and end of people. You might represent their views in the conversation. Even if it's just in the conversations, re-election. I mean, my objective was to ensure that our voices were included in the conversation. So I think the conversation did change and he was really lovely to see a lot of"
"People coming together and like, reading all these resources for election. On this election was really exciting. How actually looked and I expected. So I was, I was kind of pleasantly surprised by that, but of course, other things happened that I predicted,"
"Empty and not even with many years of experience in in politics and also being of like the minority race and gender key. Because within the party, I'm treated as an equal and you don't even when we have discussions on all the workers party members of parliament. It's always an open discussion and I'm always invited to contribute my opinions or views but you know in Parliament it is pretty daunting, especially size sit in the media Gallery because of covid and the music Alley, overlooks. The entire Parliament and just stepping in and and seeing, you know, the speaker's chair and, and all the other seats on the sides and things like that."
"It's a pretty daunting experience and now because of our lives, so I can, if I make a mistake, or if I trip, I've had nightmares are, like, I should because there are so many steps to the party, like I trip on the way to the podium and things like that. So yeah, it is pretty daunting pilot. Yeah. I work a lot on the contents of the speech and then of course, I do like rehearse quite a bit and also, you know, I think about the questions I could be off and and how I I would answer them. It takes a lot of time."
"For me to prepare for Parliament and my team works really hard and researching the content and end. But the topics that I want to speak on it. For example, for the German motion on my team, and I spent hours and hours and hours, preparing it. And I spent, you know, just as much time rehearsing it and yeah, going through it again, even though each has ever been, my parents brought me up. So, I grew up in a house where everyone's opinion matters, and because of that, I was given the confidence."
"Do you know I always speak my mind. So I I carry that confidence with me know where I go in and when I have conversations, I think it translates into you later life. Right now is where you feel like you don't deserve me at times. It seems like everybody's opinion is that you are also a reason mother to journey of juggling motherhood and politics being for you. It's not been easy, but it's easier because of the support I have at home to my mom. Helps."
"Care 4 kids. And you know, very very early on even before my first son was born. We did have a discussion around gender roles and how we would never get that within a relationship and how we would never get the role of caregiving. And we did decide that, you know, it should be 50/50 and for the most part it has so it cuz his work days, lot more structured. So in the evenings, he takes his children and during the weekends as well. So that's like usually when I'm the busiest on house, visit the people session and so he takes like a very very proactive role in that regard. I mean, this is a bit of like a contentious issue is or how has it changed your career."
Probably has it.
"Also, because I mean, like as a, as a mother who carried the baby, has it been tiring For You especially since I guess being an MP is exhausted. But because like I said, my husband and I like share the role of of being parents equally and we're both equally talk about the struggles of caregiving and how much of a toll it takes on people and and unfortunately majority of caregivers are women. So I think it is important to talk about in that aspect. You know, how do we move the conversation from Mike? You know, how is motherhood impacted your career to? How can we balance the role of caregiving at home? And that Inc?"
"Foods things like household chores, even you know, cooking and, and organizing our children's lives because it's not only the fact that you have to take care of your children, but you have to organize many things as well and that takes an emotional toll on on whoever's doing it. So I think it would be good to start having that conversation. I think we work, we are moving towards having that conversation and how we can pay a balance in, in, in our household. Yeah, the one year anniversary, skins police report was made against you and some of the racist remarks that you made on social media."
"Yeah. Yeah. I mean I bring the whole incident was happening at so many things, right? No idea of like it was you and then there was this, why do you have like young versus? They were so many like him still happening in the country and then on the flip side or generation was it definitely was a very tough time. But I think the only positive about that is it did bring conversations around race and inequality to the Forefront of the election. I think, especially with young people. So I think I'm going to meet at that. I see, but it definitely did begin, some very important conversations as well."
"When I was on house visits when I was speaking to Residents who were, you know, from the older generation. And, you know, there are people who came to me and said, and undies are older people. Can you suggest, you know, I did, I did experience or I did encounter racism, but then of course, there are also people who are saying, you know, what you did was wrong. And yeah. Yeah, they did. I'm someone who's not phased by tough conversation. So I think I saw that as an opportunity to have, you know, of very civil discussion on raised in an inequality and even though we didn't always always meet eye-to-eye at the end of the conversation at least they were able to see that, you know, you could have a rational conversation about it and perhaps that was something that they wanted to see in and their representative."
"A private Hot Springs underneath a publisher. Al Gonzalez re-watch a new episode, every alternate Tuesdays on YouTube on Spotify and Google Cast. Every alternate.

"Now, back to the episode."
"There has been a couple of incidents on racism that have a cut in the last couple of months. I didn't really know. But one is the one where the ex Indonesia couple in. And then the one we saw it would like showing a lot of words like these incidents of racism, but I think about you when you saw it definitely affects me to a very large degree, so I do feel very"
"Show me about the racism in and it's prevalent in our society. By I do have many, like emotions and and I mean, you know, people think that emotions and politics is a bad thing. But I do feel like you do need some, some form of funeral empathy and being able to understand what people going through. So I do I did feel like these incidences very deeply and you know, it did affect me for quite a while especially because as a young mother and I really do think about how erase my two children in this country. And and I think that even though we see the races and that's very obvious and and you are very aggressive. There is some form of undercurrent of racism, in our institutions, like our schools and workplaces. So I that's why I mean I did bring up the topic of racism in schools in Parliament and I did ask the question. If we could publicize the event."
"Number of of incidences of racism in school so we can do, you know, if if this is a problem and if it's something that we can address and of course, you know, the workers party, we have kind of campaign for anti-discrimination legislation in in workplaces to protect you. No minorities. And this this is not just an official minorities. It can also be, you know, people disability going to make it this minute in workplaces Hazard. Torino stamping out misogyny that Snowman in summer places to run in and get me something to eat. We keep having the same type of conversation race again."
"Bring up a video of Another Empty, basically, skin. Some young adults about the brush was like this is a 16. If you'd like. We are talking about the same thing. You always do. A struggling with the same problems. Is that thing for you? You you like we have made little progress in terms of Pokemon res. It's tough for me because I don't know what to measure this progress on. So, you know, I'm still like reflecting and thinking about this but I did have a conversation with someone the other day and you know, they said that progress looks like you so someone like me was elected a minority. Emily MP who you know, was also the youngest in recent history. So I think that I think should count as program because you know, for a long time even"
"For me, personally, I did feel represented in Parliament. But now I know we have for a position and peas for minority communities. So I think, you know, yeah, that does smell like Progressive legislation on furthering competition to see if you do encounter racism around, you don't dismiss it. Especially if it's being done to you know, someone that you know, or even just someone that that you work with or or you go to school with I think that's important because a lot of times are in positions of Power and Ray."
"Do you have the ability to call out these things out? And I can do, you know also apply to things like sexism. I think rejecting racism is important and it's an important first step. We haven't reached that point yet where we can have in-depth discussions on race and then come up with Solutions, especially if my interactions with all the different types of residence, I mean, racism is still such a taboo subject and I do feel that people can be so casually racist without knowing. So, even things like casual racism in, in microaggressions are not really spoken about concerns about them were dismissed. And I think, you know, we really need to look at the impact of these very casual forms of discrimination, especially on minorities. And just so, you know, how is a country we can progress forward."
"Soul searching by in general incident of life. I do think there's a gap in the generations, so I can the past Generations didn't really racism or, or didn't realize that what was happening was racist, but I think now, you know, where more aware of of the struggles that each of us face. And, you know, I think we are ready to have this very tough conversations and I and I mean this was showing last year like you need to bring election. I think it's just, how can we have these conversations in an open and non-judgmental way? And more, most importantly, come up with Solutions, you know, cuz I think having discussions over and over again."
"Does it really helped us to move forward? Some really need to come up with Concrete Solutions? And you know, I'm repeating myself. But like I said, none of them is none and discrimination legislation so we can start protecting a workers in their workplaces. And you know, and and start creating a culture that doesn't accept racism even in its most casual form."
It's not even like somebody generation seems like the majority be counterproductive for minority.
"But I think the first step is to recognize that there is a problem. So I think even then there's a barrier. I think we recognized that very obvious forms of racism. Like you harass me, and you didn't assault, like like that person who was attacking this interracial couple. We are able to recognize that. But I think where we haven't progressed is that we don't recognize the Insidious forms of racism, passive racism, in our schools, and our workplaces, and I do think that you have constructive conversations on that. We have to create an environment where minorities feel heard. I think it's important to include the major stakeholders in this conversation, which is minorities. And I think, you know, we should take a second step back and be more open to listening into learning rather than just, you know,"
"Try and stick some solutions to help you suck on things, like what police arrest, man, you know, sexual violence is violence, as you know, these issues are the lived experiences of many. And as someone who's been given the privilege to represent people in Parliament. I do feel that it's important that we give people who are often unheard a voice and you know, that their issues and concerns are elevated. I also questioned a few months ago on."
"How many cases of reported sexual assault? There are in Singapore. And the answer the answer. Was that from 2017 to 2019? There, almost 7,500 reported cases of sexual assault. That's 650. So to me that number was your shocking. It did show me that. We need to address this in a very important and holistic way, you know, we start doing research on sexual education and and how miners are taught about boundaries, consent bodily, autonomy and respect for one another and we did see that. There's only a nationally government-mandated program that starts in primary five. So before that date, do you have a few lessons here and there but it's not structured and it's not mandated in every school. So, I did think that you might support that, we started preschool because that's where"
"Children are building their foundations. And that's where they learn to create boundaries and and things like that. So I think it's important that we teach consent in an open and non-judgmental ways to preschoolers. The first time. He has such a specific sexuality, education can be quite like a taboo topic. Nothing, don't know. I think it's important that we distinguish sexuality education from just sex. So it's not about just sex is about learning can send, it's about learning, you know,"
"Respect for one another and also even learning about your own body. So learning about you things. Like what's a good touch with the bad touch and learning, how to speak out? When something that makes you feel? Uncomfortable is happening to you. I think there was some concerns as well that you know parents should be leading the conversation. But you only 50% of parents in a survey was conducted by where are comfortable talking to their children, about sexuality education. And not all children come from your loving and caring home. Some of them come from abusive homes. So if we don't reach to those children where we're not really taking responsibility of minor, seriously, what are some of the most memorable incidents? Like this has been? So there are few one was, we were"
"Doing house visits and I bumped into this young girl and she's wearing the hijab. And she was coming to me in tears actually because she felt like, you know, she's never been represented before and she really felt like seeing me and the political Arena gave her hope that, you know, in the future. Maybe she could you to make a difference. As the second one actually was one that really touched me in a time where I think I was going to very like dark place to those is hashtag on Twitter called cats for Lisa and I love cats and that like doing a time where I thought the world was like crashing around me and it was really tough time. So I'm like seeing that hashtag and like, you know, seeing people share their passion and pictures of the pets for me. Like they're, they're even like a it's and even like some more exotic pets. Yeah. It was really really touching and and I saw it like he was such a symbol of"
"Compassion that the younger generation has. And I think that's what, that's what I noticed. Three collections was that people who, like, we're coming from a place of understanding, empathy, and compassion, where a lot of the young people that I met. And yeah, I mean, there's definitely a lot of pressure, but I think it's important, you know, what to do to always be kept on my toes. Because, you know, I find this is a really, really important job, you know, and I take it, really serious. I invest pretty much my whole life in it. I sacrificed a lot of things like my own career and and you don't even time with my family. But, you know, I recognize that I've been given a very important role and I do take it seriously."
"For the rest, I think, you know, the next three years. That's like a lot of hard work, a lot of dedication, line of Blood, Sweat, and Tears. But I think, you know, we, we are just looking forward to building a presence in Parliament and to serve our residents as best as we can and a half ago or even a year ago. I would never have imagined that. I would be where I am today as a member of Parliament. And as a representative to a g r, a c. I hope that seeing me in this position other people, people would also be empowered to claim. There's steak and other positions of power."
"Santa Clarita. Thanks for inviting me in mp, find the voices of women across southeast Asia. You really couldn't have come this far into, so you guys want to keep something private.

"Hello. You guys turn on the screen or if you like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory about yourself about what you do and you're showing all that. Well, I am I got on 25 and and I and I got to be a great to my title as well cuz I'm not a mother who know. Right now. It's crazy. Like I have for now in the world is for as long as I had it in my stomach, you know, it's very surreal. I do you guys think you know, people don't really want to have children these days. My reason is very simple. I think it will affect my career ten years ago. I would, my goal is to have a baby."
"By the age of 28. And I are to be married by 26 right here, but I'm already almost in 27 still single. And I think this is great for me in this phase of my life because I don't want anything to get in the way of my career at least for now. It kind of set me down before I got married and then he kind of asked me like I used to work at 8 already set. It is happening. Okay, if that's the case then are you going to have kids and like yeah, that's about the bed. And then you said okay can you not have kids in the car pushing it as much as he can? But now retailing and I'm like that's actually a huge red flag and I feel like that's there is a reason why he's going for the company but"
"Is that like if you're out of sight, out of mind for a bit, but then I realized there's actually more to life Baby. Luna plant."
I know you was not playing.

"This is Dad's party at the beginning of September. I chanced upon this headline in a local newspaper about a court making history as the first emails witnessing appalled. If you jump right in all 38 years that it's been helpful and I caught from the other call. Akeem and Unapologetic debut collection gives back to contact buzz from menstruation to sexuality. Somebody called this in front of soap right now. But what was even more interesting to me was their friend mentioned that. She knew this poet Maryland hunting from her days in school and that Marilyn had an interesting back story which let where she forced it to pick up the phone and decided that her story was strength. Bazillion courage, a lot of honesty and coming to terms with a self vs. Maryland Lottery."
"Hi, I'm Marilyn ton, and I am 27 this year. I am one of those degenerate fullest."
"I feel like a lot of poets and really make money with our art of profession. And I mean, I said it before, I like there is no money in poetry specially if you aren't Singapore. So degenerative, you know kind of like one of those things where you go for Chinese New Year and your your family is like, what are you doing? Because"
"very generic, and I feel like"
"It's very hard to look for work as a writer art to make it as a poet as a profession. I want to see I mean I can explain the reason why I invited you on his podcast today because he made history as the first one in three of the Singapore Price, Rite price was the price that you wanted like $3,000."
Turn off light.
Is the value of no?
"So what happens if you run from, you know, any style, whatever, but didn't get a single, send the oldest running literary price in Singapore. So you would think that you know, like it money is going anywhere."
Thanks a lot.
"If you just tell me, what was the"
"Piece of work. Okay, so is my debut volume and he's back."
"I like to, I like to describe it as the transition rail lesbo, Rich reward. You never hear you. So it's basically a collection collection because it's meant to be read as a whole experience, right? From start to finish. So it's not really an anthology of poems or our collection of poems to work together, and it uses Witchcraft and the Occult as a vehicle for the Emancipation off of individual in a sexist patriarchal, a blue homophobic, transphobic Society. Using something that I really loved, which was the the tools are magic and Witchcraft talk about"
See what type of genre lesbo? Which grimoire you never know. Unless we allow transgender. It's fine honey. Trans Lesbos. Love it.
"Friends genre grimoire spell, so I intended it in my first proposal for the book. I intended it to be a witch and a recipe book, a recipe for Insurrection. I think is how 2017"
Talking about how you got to where you are. I'm going to ask you to share a bit about your journey.
Over the last 10 years you been through and how it can affect sheep.
"Aditi up, to up to the point when I was about 17. I kind, of course, you know, being white happened to me in my 230 years to where I was kind of"
I guess violated in in a way that crossed my personal boundaries and I don't know how to explain this. Like I was recorded against my will doing some private and I find I was forced to withdraw from school.
I guess.
"There to be any repercussions. But I mean, it was, it was a sexual act, a high-profile school. And I think the people there or, or is it that I had didn't have any such a so far for a while, we were actually sending and it wasn't just me, somebody, actually the local, the local newspaper. So you don't, you have your school and your school and your National newspaper all coming together and, you know, kind of"
"I just condemn you, but also"
"You got it for this act and I won't say that it was something that I had every right to do. It was definitely a moment of indiscretion, but I think that what struck me about the whole incident was the amount of"
Casual cruelty that it was treated with sickness. I mean I was
"young at the time, you know, I wasn't it was 10 years ago and those who were there to help me do my teachers my"
"I don't know why it's the authorities in charge are definitely my parents stood by me in the whole process using a face in the in the system. And in the people who are there to pick care of me, right? Like, in hindsight, because up to that point. I didn't really think I really do feel like you're invincible and when you're in the system for likes me your July."
I see that anything that happened. I guess after that. What happened? What transpired was that everyone kind of?
"After of the circulator thing, right? It actually happens that some someone got wind of it. I see. And the school authorities got wind of it and I was"
"I was under investigation. So it was kind of like a by the school by the school. Yeah, so I was placed under this I guess."
"Police interrogation on it because you did something wrong criminal act. And I think that calling for me was that nobody was punished for the video in the streets, even, you know, so I'm sure somebody like that because they didn't get rid of them."
It was.
"Perhaps, it doesn't doesn't seem unfair to a lot of people, but it just seemed like the burden of sticking, to the status quo based solely on my shoulders and a lot. And you know, other slap on the wrist for violating of the peoples of the University case, but it is I think symptomatic on the Greaser. Systemic."
"Inequality or are sanctioning of, you know, undesirable. And I think to a lot of people in this country."
"Less offensive to record something in Jesus than it is to be doing doing the bed or Christmas Eve, but it really showed me how violent and educational system as well as the the way in which homophobia and violence against young women to be acceptable and connected in the guise of respectability politics. So much is how much is lost and so much as damaged in the name of"
Trying to seem respectable to stakeholders on to power or to the school.
"I left you have to, you have to withdraw out of your own will or will expel you. You know, it was a forced choice, and I think the reasoning was it looks better if you was drawn, right? I mean, it's whatever, right? If, if you go, so I went to and I did psychology."
"With the same, with the same girl, who is we we left and initially this was the fact that part as well. Initially. Everybody was saying, you guys should not keep in contact anymore. And you guys should stay away from each other. You know, I like, don't talk to each other don't ever, I guess."
"I just don't be friends or are you don't be in each other in each other's lives because you guys are obviously bad for each other. Right? And it was my parents. It wasn't just my phone saying this. It was, you would be so interested in my personal life. Exactly. Are, you know, what, what happened to me after that? I think that you know, it was just another way to kind of control the situation control and make sure we don't do any more damage to the right. So I've never been very good at keeping away from someone that I wanted to talk to and especially when you're so young and"
They all don't talk about this anymore. I don't want to talk to anybody about this because then who's left with the trauma?
"Yeah, it's just me right? And like who do I do like with the trauma with is it just is it just going to be me like working through? It could be because I know a lot of people who have had that same."
"Romo or is that seem kind of owe, you know, everything is cool blows up in your face and all of a sudden you're ripped from your friend. The people that you consider yourself closest to that your family and you're forced to kind of live away from even given the person that you love, right? Because a lot of people fall in love at the age and especially if you are gay or if you're if you're homosexual, it's very easy for your all your parents to say. Oh no, we don't want you talking to this person made you gay or they were. So I feel very sorry for school because of the Jesus because I I know what that's like and a lot of people have said to me that they don't"
"You're not in contact with the people that the you, no, excuse that, with anymore, or they were ripped away from the situation and no one wonders what it would have been like, if they were just allowed to live out their businesses, right?"
"So that I'm very sorry that I think it's very interesting, this idea of somewhere. You know, that life."
"I guess you can say, I'm pleased to protect you as a child in or you know that I always have your back and then"
"Be investigated for a criminal criminal Xiao. The principal actually said she wanted to call the police. She told my parents that she actually thought about calling the police, but, you know, Anna in a moment of magnanimous."
Sounds like thanks again. Thanks.

What one of the other light?
Issues at the Apollo.
Romantic video.
"Never really understand that you have a chance or whatever and you get bullied and you get harassed by your teachers even brought, you know, whatever it is. That is more or less invisible to people who are not."
"In those circles or who don't fall in the line, but you wouldn't just that one person who had been circulating, whatever. I'm supposed to be both agree, that it and then I also like the system."
I can imagine what kind of feelings were left with everything. They have to write. How did you
Badly at first. And then I think that I was
"Very afraid to be out, publicly are at least even to my roommate because, you know that the process of coming out to yourself to your, your family and your friend, you kind of stunt it in a week and you enjoy that process. So so much. So that the individual feels shame, right? They feel like they're all the same and violence and Trauma associated with my view who I am, and it is because I was who I am that this target so much."
"Directions. If I was, you know, if I was straight for example, in and do the same thing, you wouldn't be such a big deal. Definitely use. Definitely, it wouldn't have been presented such a sweetie and titillating way in the in the headline is named but that was very much the same stuff like home. Look at this like extremely kinky things going on. You don't internalize that I think was a very it did a number on the way. I interacted with my classmates after this, after the fact, but I say that SI group"
"And I think that part of the reason I'm just in which one of my classmates actually said very like a fairy in a in a very secretive way to someone other classmates. And he came to Pauline, right? To the Polytechnic and visit. So,"
"You so much for your environment. I feel so. Yeah, probably text me. That helps you see. I see other artists things things that were uncomfortable things, things that were I guess, just comforting for other people, right, for themselves to say as well. So you can see that. Let's see what I can find a way to Heart."
The system in life parties as a result of death.
"From the incident, like how they develop."
"Shiba Inu, yashiki, you know, I feel like my relationship evolved definitely from the single, but we've always kind of had people like to be 43."
"Gay male poets, that kind of first introduced me to what?"
"Local issues. Especially Ian, who will and forever will be my first love taught me a lot about the voice of dissent and the voice of"
"Saying things that such a sight. Singapore. And its governing, I guess these are the structures that we are all beholden to write in this country. And I remember being fifteen years old and I'm picking up 150 H in the school library is in the library. And it talks about like the silver flag being like blood and semen and it was just absolutely invigorating for be, right? And I had never imagined that you could talk about art and as Singapore and nice and come. And I think I've always kind of carried that with me. So, I think when this particular incident happened to me, it was really a turning point."
"Cuz then I started being very conscious of my place in the world. Not just as a very privileged being, right? Somebody who is Able Body and Fender and and 7 and fries and thing and Chinese. But also someone who I know Nick's to marginalize the adjacent to I guess queerness and you know, all of all of the things that come with it. I mean, I'm not going to sleep for that but"
"And I mean I have very supportive parents. So it's it's way different. You know, how do you like you really have to hand it to them? Because up until that incident, they will also hang a flag disapproving of homosexuality and it actually took them about 7 years ago. From my mom. My mom said my dad a dinner, like it's not about the person and I just amazing transformation because I don't remember. I don't remember like,"
Quiet kind of hedge. Does that continuously negotiate that you mentioned it?
"Yeah, for sure. I'm not super religious. So I mean my family goes to church or the but I think I kind of fell out with the church when this thing happened as well. And before that. I was already kind of having my, you know, my religious crisis like every every baby Catholic a ghost."
"It was very interesting because it actually didn't take a lot for my parents to acknowledge that. The church was doing something to me. That wasn't totally healthy because I struggle with them for a couple of months and then I was left it at that, but I don't consider myself. It really isn't such a thing is kind of like oh, you know, I have a lot of"
You are baptized. Are you are in your conference? Jessica say it's kind of an indelible Mark kind of but I also like I'm always kind of going to derive my cultural and religious preference.
"Yeah, Wells. And is kind of a big part of what inform my belief, right? At like uncritically endures the church and there's so many contradictions and that's just not the confusion that I can see anybody, but I want I guess on. How did you buy some?"
He could very well go both ways.
"Blossom so much as like fermented a horrible, did that like crawled out of the storm? You know, it it really felt like I had to go underground for a number of years before I like dragged. My boss is this."
"So when people ask me, you know, why, how do you write with such abandon? Because you know, someone has actually asked me that before but it's more like, you know, like The Obedience in me kind of diet because I was always a very partly why my mother was so surprised that just happened until I went to the ER like I stole a pencil."
"I was on the best at school by was pretty good. You know what I was doing? Okay, I was on track to becoming your typical middle-class like Chinese University graduate, right? And then it was like,"
"I guess the rules don't apply anymore. I guess if I play the game it doesn't you know, it's not going to reward me anymore. So why play by the rules anymore? Right? But I will say also is that"
Encountering this.
"Set back kind of galvanized. Me, too."
"Well, it was kind of like somebody's threatening me and say you know, this is your last chance to make it good or otherwise always tougher always, you know, just language in like a failure."
I'm going to be the best.
I got to be the best EX.
"Yeah, so I I did much better for otherwise, I feel because that was all it was always. His unconscious has threatened the back of my head. So it was like, oh, I have already put my parents through this month. I should not put anything else ever again in life. Right? And I was kind of my barter for them. If I see something of myself academically, then do whatever the hell I want. You know, I can write in Spotlight for something day."
"I mean, you know, like my friend said she was like, oh, is this establishment recognition now? Because I have spent so long saying establishment bad. Yep. Yep, and I feel that and I know everybody's going to ask me. Oh, so how do you feel about award award shows? And I can't be like a washer that bullshit. Because then, you know, it, it kind of makes me look. It doesn't make me look but I, I feel I'm grateful. I feel very then. It's, it's very dismissive of everybody who won before and everybody in the rent in the running and all of the female poets that I admire."
"What does it release? And I think that honestly it's not so much about me as I told SPCA. I think it's about being open to narratives and being open to stories that are different from the ones that we hold so far. I mean come on man is the award has been running for 28 years, you know, like longer than I've been alive and to be the first woman. I feel this deep sense of like, oh really not like any woman before this, but also I think that so you're going to try it. One of the judges was very kind of felt it and he said that you know, it was it was really unlike."
"Poetry collection agency in because it was it reminded us. Of course you can do for yourself and the senses and I guess galvanized social change right of reminding us and an unmeaning as well. And a part of me feels very Vindicated because that is really what I set out to do. When I was first conceptualizing, the book, I said to one of my fellow poet and I said, you know, I want this book to be dangerous. I want this, you know, I want this to be a really"
"You know, I wanted to hurt, you know, where it hurts. So I just like to OK Google. Let's go to Feel Like I Do by. I do run on speight and like, you know, this is being said that if if no one's going to do it then it has to be done."
I want to talk a bit about it about.
This whole idea of explaining About It by using in the world. Are you talking about witchcraft?
"For sure, for sure."
"Witchcraft or feminine in feminism lesbian with you. So I think that my understanding of Witchcraft and feminism kind of developed in parallel with each other, right? So, I was mentioning that I fell out of love with the church. I don't know if I fell out of love with me, but I went on. So it's like a journey."
"To to see what fruits that was in religion or spirituality, or, you know, what have you? But I think it was very helpful for me to think about Witchcraft and the cold as a way of accessing feminism. That was not sanctioned by the larger part of mainstream Society because you know, I mean witchcraft has been a Revival in the past decade or so, right. So excited with the rise of the me-too movement and the fact that women all over the world are taking a stand against the patriarchy and it seems like there really is, you know, I mean, people call it the fourth wave of feminism and it really is"
"an uprising, right of some kind of a paradigm, shift of some kind, collectively, all over the world, and I found it very, very powerful and yet,"
"It's so hard to overthrow what you already know and believe about the system that we live in, you know, how do you say it's very hard to subvert the system that we already live in, right? And if you talk about things like gender roles. Did you talk about things? Like, how to be? I guess an effective woman are an attractive person. You have to go back to do. What is expected of me as a gendered or a sexual being, right? And Witchcraft for me in. And they said, you know, it's okay, ugly. It's okay. It's okay to see."
"Femininity is kind of decried, as, you know, being filthy or or it has to be extremely police by, you know, whatever, whatever system we live in. Whether or not, it's just a tourist family or school. I mean, you see it, right?"
"And you know, if you are able to access the archetypes of women who are not obedient woman, then that kind of power is very informative for you. For me. I always say I have big Crone energy just like, you know, the archetype of the really ugly and misshapen woman, living in the woods, like being a cop's wife, which is helping women, do abortions and very strongly with. And, you know,"
"Brianna that. I would imagine. And even myself, right? A step further in the ejecting, whatever."
"How do I conscious enough to Life Away? Whatever you spend so much of a Beautyrest feminine. Beauty is about, you know, you have to like if you have this aging like skin whitening blah blah blah and I can't wait to become like the hag that I always did, like the hanging."
Final form.
"Like its delivery to to not be afraid of growing old in a sense, right? And that's exactly what I guess. You know, like the old white men off of whatever beauty company like, they found it, don't want you to know, they don't want to just, you know, like even not shaving for example."
"Check to see great for me even in my, in my adolescence and in my early twenties. It was it was kind of a thing where I I had this conflict inside me, and I didn't know whether or not to shave to be attractive and you do not shave because it was more comfortable. And finally, I decided that, you know, like Quivers finding me attractive."
"Yeah, and that in a in a sentence."
"Liberate, I do acknowledge that a skinny Chinese girl. I have access to that. That a lot of other people don't have any people who are racial minorities people who are fat people who are disabled. For example, if they don't have the same forms of Social and sexual Capital that I do so I can rely on you know, like the way I generally looked yet. You know what I'll do if other people are already seen as viable as by the state or by a society then"
"Of course, they're not going to be able to access that apartment, and it's going to be for them yet another form of I guess."
Putting them down off of being you know marginalized for having like a interesting because he never then what is a suggested these people? How do you tell them that?
How do you get them on the pasta?
"Well, I'm not really like to, but I also feel of that you do what you can write to feel empowered. If you don't have to go very, if being defeating up well and having puth eyebrows and she's on 5th and, you know, she's legs does it for you and make you feel beautiful and Powerful, then do it but know why you are doing it, you know? Because you find my power in being that like, don't don't do it for somebody else to somebody else says you should look like that, but you don't feel like that on the inside of the things that you do."
"For yourself whether it is to make your life easier, you know because if you know Technologies of the self you need to understand why it is you do something that you do in the space in which you live for. Sure. You can you can access empowerment and still sort of look like you are compliant with the Norms of whatever it is that you are at that point in time. You just have to know why you're doing it, right?"
"Are you comfortable that you feel good? I ate. Are you why you do you feel good? Because I think a lot of women are not that question or even at all because woman's pleasure is not seen as something that I think that is right from I want to I want you to know that my Pleasures is Portage and your pleasures important as like if you need to masturbate four times a day. That's also important. You know, it's very important to pick one and I think that"
"If you write from a place of pleasure, you also access your power, right? Like you need to kind of excesses that pleasure, SS, who you are, and what you desire. Well."
They often wish you ugly away. Feel kind of.
"Not accepted by our peers or even ourselves, right? I wish that we looked like someone else, you know, we were someone else and I feel that"
"That's really a source of power. Not mother wishing to be someone else, but they're actually being somebody else. And, you know, being a messy whole time is something that's very valuable to me because it wasn't something. That was something that you had to hide a way. Are you always had to be? I always, I always describe my parents as well. So I think that there is a sudden"
"Hours that I won't say. It is a fault. It is in a source of empowerment. It really is kind of freedom to lean into the parts of yourself. You hate and rescue them. And as my mentor always said, you know, a creative act is so a rescue of the destructive act together and she just kind of changed a lot of things for me, especially with regards to thinking about, you know, even poetry and, and a voice. And she's the one who turned me on to audre Lorde, you know."
"Idea, that silence is violence on to yourself. And if you know, you feel unattractive, or you feel unloved or you feel like you're just generally,"
"The heart, you know in because there is nothing that is more freeing, that's more enjoyable. And what vegetable to watch somebody taking joy in."

"Having a plan and Ira is, can you say that? Can you say that? I am Hazel and I'm drained and welcome back to this episode of clarity's."
"I got the DVD in the studio today because she is facing some issue health issues, but not to worry. She's resting. Well, and the place that we often go to the second in the throat London. Oh, goodness. Gracious. Me. I was one episode that you couldn't join us. You know, it just feels different. I think the house podcast just isn't complete without any of you go discuss something that I think I'm guilty of you mentioned in episode, to remember when we talked about toxic masculinity. You brought up this point about how you hate it, when your partner is spicy, the plan, everything, right?"
"What do you do? Do you still hate it when I expect you to plan everything. All right. I just mentioned this over the past weekend. Okay, because I like to do like weekend bunches, right? And then just so happened that that Sunday, so she had something on in the morning. So I said, he wasn't about me. Okay, and then after which, I texted him, and I said, so, where are we going? Which means like, give me a pace, right? Right. Right, right."
"Today we're going to discuss something called the men to look. Okay? All right, so we went to at the time if it was a gender thing, like I mentioned having a partner playing all your things for you about. We spoke about how women seem to be the gender that I always expected to plan for things because we are known to be meticulous or the better better. Yeah. This is not an episode full of complaints. Definitely not opening this up for discussion looking. So if you have any thoughts can just feel free to slide into DM's as well, but apparently, and unfortunately, I think you're right. It is a gender issue. Women, especially mothers in a two-parent hetrosexual, family."
"Somehow I suspect that the run things. As if the project managers just know when you mentioned delegating the right. I think some people have an issue with it. Okay? To the vet, the route of the mental issue. I agree. I agree. That was a very famous, crikey, that went viral some time ago. So basically, it starts off with this person, visiting a friend's house. Okay, and so the sit woman here, running around the house trying to feed it to the same time and has a stinger talkin to the guests and they need to get doing his part as a host. And the party is overflowing overflow with babies crying babies. Crying time is running out. That's right. And what does the guy say?"
Why you never asked me for help?
But it feels like.
"A little bit, right? It's like"
"You know, like what do you need me to remind you of? Why do you need me to say all I didn't ask. Is it not obvious that I was running around so many things? Do you think it's like a never-ending things? The first you have to keep asking him to do what you have to do this when they do it over the UK."
"Hello. In, let's in the kitchen. Okay, so I'm cooking something for example. So I can cook buy washing. Okay, so everybody will always want. That's okay. He wants to help me or he asked if I need help. And I see, I can you help me? Like, for example, peel the potatoes and chop it up. Okay, OK. And it's something that I know I can do it, like, 2 minutes. Okay, but maybe 10 minutes as pasta, and he still like, my mom, had to take a minute. Okay. I will come down. I cannot listen to do it the way I want to avoid enough, that he's already."
"Correct. Correct Sooner Mall to Meadowlark dentist house will. Once again, what is mental load? It is not just about the physical tasks. But rather the oldest thing of all this house is being the one in charge of having the NeverEnding list of to-do items constantly running about in your head. Remembering what needs to get done by when and delegating all the types of respected family members, your children, your husband and actually making sure they get done correctly or really like a project manager that far beyond just doing them."
"You are the best ways to remember the plan and direct is it. Can you say that if you want you part of the plan and direct all micromanage? You. Make sure you pay her for a role as household of relationship manager in the salary. Number one. OK? As a geisha, a project manager is an average of $76,188 every year."
"Finance manager, $18,132 every year business manager of this $131,294 every year, somewhere else for you also have this expectation to run certain things. For example, example, I'm the message line, right? Okay. I feel like he does more choice and I do, okay, like he will literally say that okay with you."
"I think about it and I'm not sure I do it. Why is it that when he says that he's going to do it, that I feel that I'm not doing my job. How come I feel that way, you know, I mean am I supposed to do it and sit? Why do we have this perception? Like, oh he's volunteering to do it or if he saying to do? It means what I didn't do. My job."
I am Hazel Highway 109 Jermaine and welcome back to this episode of clarity's.
"I ordered a video of it said in the studio today because she is facing some issue health issues, but not to worry. She's recovering. Well, yeah, I just feels right incomplete and went for lunch at the place that we often go through. Goodness. Gracious. Me. I really was one episode that you couldn't join us for the recording as well. And, you know, it just feels different. I think the Hoge podcast just isn't complete without any of you girls. So here's wishing you a speedy recovery and join us in the next episode. OK, Google. Do remember when we talked about toxic masculinity, you brought up this point about how you hate it. When your partner is spicy, the plan. Everything."
Inspired by me.
"What do you do? Do you still hate it? When I expect you to plan everything actually, right? I just mentioned this over the past weekend. Okay, because I like to be like weekend brunch s, right? And then I'm just so happened that that Sunday. So he had something on in the morning for a so he wouldn't about me. Okay, and then after which, I texted him, and I said, so, where we going? Which means I give me a piece, right? Right. Right, right."
"Oh my God, I didn't guys and goes we have any two different systems altogether. Amazes me how the hell do they even think? You know, that?"
"And yet who gave a place all the time. Are you upset that this has to happen all the time, you know, I don't want a wine, but if I decide to fight"
"Don't fight. If you can always make sure you in wide width wise words. Okay. Today, we're going to discuss something called the men to look. Okay? All right, so we went to at the time if it was a gender thing, like you mention, your partner plan, all your things for you, but we spoke about how women seem to be the gender that I always expected to plan for things because we are known to be meticulous all the best of the correct. Correct. It's true. They have to be. This is your moment, Big, Lots of a plan as we have to manage a planned event or they realize the house. How tall is, right. I don't see why this has to be this week, but this is not an episode full of complaints. Definitely not at all. Opening this up for discussion."
"Is a gender issue, women, especially mothers in a two-parent heterosexual family?"
"I expect that the run things as they get project managers but not because they are meticulous all the better plan on, what do you think that is right, but if you think about it, right? Maybe it started as a child as your mother takes care of everything, right? I think it's the way we are and how like social conditioning and how we've been taught that in families. All the primary role in society. Women is the caregiver, do they still feel like an instinctive thing? I guess, you know how like if meals have the instinct to like provide for the family place on Bulverde and then we have this instinct to my run the show. I really do think it's because a lot of mothers like my mother herself. She thinks that she knows better for the family. You know what I mean? So, sometimes, I think it's also. It's also the women's role to play to delegate the work instead of thinking that, you know, because you're better at this, let me just do everything. Okay."
"But like, on the top of delegating, right? I think that two things you do, sometimes women delegate and then"
"Maybe the chocolates like the way you want it to be. Exactly. And then eventually did I think it's not a good point to think I have back when I was due date in Jordan right now. I feel like I experienced this quite a bit together. You know what? I mean? It's just like the little things. No company here. Once again in the morning after we wake up and I will ask is a monkey. He just makes it like anyhow, why the blanket another girl or are you at the one-off?"
"Okay, Kathy different people have different expectations about for me. I'm unable to accept it. So I end up doing it again. But in the long run, I find this your house. Why do I have to remind you to do this? So Indian, I told myself that I can't do this anymore. I can just not let him do it because I think I can do a better job. So I made it like a, like a fun fun kind of thing. Friday morning that you'll be a little thing to make the bed together. We'll hold up different as of the blank getting a little routine. Bring us and I think it's sweet. Yeah, and at the same time, I get the expectations."
"I think this is one little way. I, I tried to go about managing my mental load, talk about what actually is getting this quite a few times. And this episode. It's actually a burden that you can't see. And smell the Lord. I find it affects particularly model true that truth feels like they have to remember everything exactly. As I remember. Everybody's schedules. They have to remember, you know, what this person is doing? What they're supposed to meet. What do I need to pack for this lesson? What do I need to prepare for this? Lesson? Play Feels Like but then right, I feel like they might be guys out there right now. Probably carry this load as well. Yeah, single fathers, for example, it's that it's more prevalent in women, but maybe the guys out there."
"Because I was chatting with me that she is so messy one at home and it wasn't the most systematic one. For example, when you just got out of bed, right time for a shower and dress up, get ready for the day. And just before you leave house, then you would honestly, right. I don't make it as nice as he doesn't do. Very nice one. Sometimes, when I really put in the effort, right to make it very nice hugs. And then when we get home, and he looks at it right by your mother."
"But see you're capable of doing it. Nice, the wall. Okay. So the issue is the site, where is missing a wall right now? I can't get it to go in my nicely. Correct. Then the middle of a problem."
"Are you okay, this mental load right in the place? It's referred to as emotional label labor, and a note from a producer. She thinks that it affects any woman actually married or unmarried any woman to take care of household. Pet moms. The single sister, was it take care of the household and the elderly parent or women. Cohabiting, a living with a partner in the house together? Aka me in my example, Jordan, just not right. Just know when you mentioned delegating the right. I think some people have an issue with that. Okay, they consider that the root of the mental issue. I agree. That was a very famous, crikey, that went viral some time ago. So basically, it starts off with this person, visiting a friend house. Okay, and so the sit woman here, running around the house."
"How does a stinger talking to the guest login sickly and they need to get doing his part as a host? And the party is overflowing, its overflowing babies cry. Baby is crying. Time is running out. That's right. And what does the guy say why you never asked me for help?"
"Then it feels like a little bit, right? It's like, you know, like what do you need me to remind you, or why do you need me to say? Oh, I didn't mean to ask. Is it not obvious that I was running around interesting things, women don't like men to get into that business. Stay out of my kitchen. Correct. Because you are getting in my way, If I can do way, I run things. I want to do things my way for is better to stay out of it. Sometimes, maybe husband the other half are conditioned to think that, you know, she doesn't want me around. I'm just thinking, could this be what happened? Which is why the husband didn't choose to step in and sit decided to give her her own space. I mean, the relationship a text to know what it means. It's true. I think women, we, we have to let go of our our expectations, and micromanaging."
"What, that's what the tensions of you too, so much. But sometimes we fail to recognize that if our other half just pitch in to give us some help. Okay, it would really, really benefit us in the long run. It's right. So, okay, that's think it is. Let's, let's Okay for the kitchen thing inside. Okay, buying something. For example, let's see something in the house is finished. Okay. Okay. So I've had many times actually, we're guys know this is finished and they don't buy it. They don't tell you that it's in Ishtar all day."
"Pain very well go and get it. But they tell you that it's finished. And can you go and get it? Right? So, it's like you live here too and you use it too. If it's finish. Why can't you go and buy it? I agree. I wouldn't want to turn on the water only to find out that there's no simple, that I would be. So angry. My day will be so affected and I would fight and I would win, don't get into a fight if you cannot win. Exactly. But this is a fair point because somehow, it's because men are like, I'll meet you and they just learn how to do things. If things are not. What do they mean? What I think you do. I think it's amazing. How can you function like this?"
"Don't care enough thing. Cuz if you can't or something enough, you would do it, right? So, I was thinking about this, right? And that was thinking about you when I was younger, for example, and my mother was out of the house and she will call me to do something so that you can, okay. I will take them long to do it. If you don't want to do it, sometimes I forget. And then she'll be like when you do something. I can do it like, immediately. Why is it that you take too long about it? It doesn't matter to me. I think, so. Do you need the model of, right? And that's why they don't bother, and it's not like, they don't love you. You know what? I mean? That's the difference, but maybe they failed to take into account that while it may not bother you very very sad poems."
"For the longest time, right? It's just been, I use the same color as my mother. Okay, and then my back has always been using a different. Okay, and then when the girls toddler and a guy, I saw that kind of being so question, which table is missing you. All right? Okay, but if let's see, no, you want to train your partner train? My partner stepping up to get it done. Okay, then you won't learn right, correct. I think I will let go ask him to do it even though I like what you mentioned, imitate fucking long for him to even"
"It done and I'll be so pissed at him but eventually I think I have to let go and accept that I don't want to be doing everything on my own. That's the difference. I don't want to fight his listeners. You want to. You want to take care of every small detail in your house. Key. Go ahead. I think it's meant to actually make you happy the best. At least I can see that he's helping me out. And this is, this is like a habit in Green in here. Okay. To in the future, you know, where exactly? You need a child, right? I need someone to help you. You can be doing everything on your own, any of it. We could be able to manage as well. The man has to pitch in to help. No matter how bad of a job. He does. He will only get better. Baby is mental thing right now, encompasses. So many things right. Do you think it's like a never-ending thing? So far? You have to keep asking him to do it? Yeah."
Wendy is also meant to look when they do it already.
"Hello in the kitchen. Okay, so I'm cooking something for example. So I can cook, but I hate washing. Okay, so everybody will always want something that's okay. I'm not washing as he wants to help me cook or he will ask. If I need help. Can you help me? Like, for example, peel the potatoes and chop it up? Okay, OK. And it's something that I know I can do it, like, 2 minutes. Okay, but maybe 10 minutes has passed and I sent and he still lonely and you didn't write it. Can you do it this way on that one, but I cannot office. Listen to do it the way I want to always say OK, Google enough that he's already want the correct statement."
"Hold it together. Thank you. Thank you. See you in the kitchen. If you want him to help out, just find the least effort to tasks for him to do, and it doesn't matter. He doesn't catch up to you. Yes, I think of it, you happy or you can see that he's at present with you and joining in this activity together. It doesn't matter what comes out of his hands, but it's already a little, a little, if your husband, he's an engineer computer coding guy, and he asked you to help him with the conduit in the same amount of time that she can I put in all cells in the other person's shoes. I guess, I guess, I guess true."
"Does a very good point. You don't need a degree to do freaking housework Wilson, ever, go to school to learn that, what is that true? Because as women, we are mothers teach us more things than they would teach some example. So, is that the root of the problem?"
His mom keeps all the boys how to do housework.
"Also the other producers like seeing her brother-in-law, your mother teach all the sons to do housework. So when they grow up they actually know how to do housework really is the environment that your brother in, you know, if growing up your parents forced you to do house with lots of them, have a very good friend. Her name is staying at the age of 15 16. She's already doing her own laundry, you know."
"I feel you and sorry, I forgot Sunday. I be done by Sunday, afternoons to do my laundry and I she was a popping clothes into the laundry in the washing machine and I thinking about hanging them up. She can brother, right? She's a brother cuz it really was him."
"I think so. The mom does not do housework for the kids. I think that's her way of raising her children to the independent fine young people. So I think thing that's on laundry and I believe your brother also got to do laundry. So, yeah, right, even though he's only 21 this year. He's a very very much real person. And these episodes been talking a lot of housework by the small to Meadowlark than just housework. Once again, what is mental load? It is not just about the physical tasks. But rather the overseeing of all this time is being the one in charge of having the NeverEnding list of to-do items constantly running about in your head. Remembering what needs to get done by when and delegating all the types of respected family members your children, your husband. Yeah, you know, and actually making sure they get done correctly or really like a project manager."
"No, we spoke about like doing them. Right but far beyond just doing them. You are the best advice to remember and you don't have it on right now, but is it a very interesting that you have any plan and Ira is motherfuking Tyree. If you want your partner to plan and direct all micromanage? You then make sure you pay her for her role as household of relationship manager in the salary. No, that was a project manager is paid an average of $76,188. Every you finance manager, $18,132 every year. Okay. I love this $131,294 every year. Can you imagine how much money we could be making?"
"The space right for you, but okay. Let's give credit to people who put the effort into trying to depart to try and pull the load and just think about how maybe we can let go of this man to look, right? I think it's very, very important, this right headlight many problems. Do, what is a being that females? I expect it to take care of the family. You're expected to assume these rules and hence, It's like because you expect it to that. Also, do the guys, for example, who sort of Leave it to you. They let it go. Yeah. Because they feel like you'll be taken care of right. But also with this expectation to run something, so I'm the messy line, right? Okay. Okay. So I feel like he does more choice and I do, okay. He will literally"
"I think about it and I'm not sure why is it that when he says that he's going to do it, that I feel that I'm not doing my job. How come I feel that way that he doesn't live here. No, I mean a question. Like should I feel bad? Am I supposed to do it and sit? Why do we have this perception? Like, oh, it's his volunteering to do it or if he saying to do. It means what I didn't do. My job. I think it's more about balancing the rules in the family, like you mentioned, how to go through mental good that your partner is already taken the first step to offer to do certain things. But are you doing your part in? Making sure the house is neat and tidy as well. You cook your country in different ways. I can't do it in different ways. I cook, I"
I waiting my presence is a gift.
"But won't know they recognize this. I think it's cooler because now, you know, maybe he's giving more in terms of no helping to keep the family. In check example. He takes his collagen. Okay? Okay. We should hang this last job. OK. Google console. Cuz if the TV, is there a couple weeks ago. Actually, he asked me to take his college in for him and they are there. And on top of the console or there was like, maybe 7-8 bottles. Okay. Okay, so I grabbed one of it."
And how come you didn't realize it was 78. Empty bottles. Oh my God. It's not clear. How you can see that. It's empty.
How the hell?
"I also find it amazing that you didn't honestly that I wouldn't have not picked up everything that you know, is it supposed to be correct? Correct? Because I thought I was lying around a while to clear his stuff. I think that's him to me, not throwing things like a right or sometimes like if I see him drink something the night before and how he told me this morning and you can just get rid of it before you sleep right now. Yeah, but then the part where he always has to ask and I could for example is like my dressing-table. Okay is all over the place."
"Or thinks night because we constantly are packing for things, right. And I never had better until I have to pay for the next thing that I am a kind of thing, you know, city of things around. Like I feel so I cannot complain. That is a very good example of one. Lucky girl, who doesn't have to experience what we call them. And tell Mom, she has a full-time job with oil, but she assumes a lot of Rosemary family. And I think she was in these rules only because she feels like she excels at them more than my father, right? Maybe she doesn't say it, but I can tell that, you know, she feels like she got things faster when she can watch the place faster things for that to do. So, I assume quite equal role in the family, but my father will help to wash clothes. My father will have to wash the dishes for when it comes to add mopping and sweeping the floor. My mom is"
"Who does it because she thinks she can do this faster. This expectation that you need from when I was a little girl to now he has never passed on to us. It's never on our siblings me. My eldest is done. Now, my younger brother ever sweep and mop the floor. I feel bad. I help out. But most of the time, I'm not at home and she doesn't have a bother me as long as I feel bad because this is how I meant to look as a mother, you know, she wants to take all of this was supposed to be nice, just to her children can can rest for work, but honestly, if I were a man myself, I wouldn't do things this way. I would want my kids to help out to do their own laundry. Paying my kids to pick up the Old Wounds, to 2 to clean the old tables. All these kind of things. I have to say. I'm very blessed by the same time. I feel like it is important for you to let go of this."
"Easy on yourself. I don't see you being so tired mentally stressed out over every single thing, you know. Yeah, it's to the point where I like sometimes when clients send me some stuff, but I thank you for that. And sometimes I'm too busy to, it just unpacked them, if you need them in the floor and then like keep everything in place and all that kind of thing. Yes. It is. It was hot for my mom to let go for her to say. Can you do this? You my father is doing a good job at washing the clothes and the dishes not even kidding."
"Sort of like, you know, if they're going to be slow with it. I'll mess it up. When we started. Also, we were not created it because we don't agree for this, right? All right, I think it's okay. I'm going to draw a parallel here with like kids, guys. Don't come at me."
"But okay, for example, right, you know how Asian pears especially their very prone to doing everything for the kids because it's safer that way, I think Weston parents tend to maybe the the last helicopter pad thing, they tend to allow you to do stuff. If you're going to fall you fall. If you are going to run around in the rain, that's fine. But like we'll be able to join the parallel directly with kids, right? I like to sort of get them to do things. Okay, they can do it, right. It just takes a bit more time and"
"It might not be perfect. But I feel like we cannot do things for them, you know, so if you want milk identify themselves, basically, this child asked me for my help and I like 5600k, right? So I got it out of the fridge. And I said, okay, you part? Okay, and somebody's at somebody else, all, and sit still. When are you going to do it for the child? You know, you just send it and you just saw that guy the Box on the back, LOL, you know what I mean, but I think it's the first step of Letting Go knowing that it feels just white, but a lot of Asians convert that hit around this. What are the go to extra trouble of wiping the treatment when I could have just bought it for the girl, like if you're eating out and they won like, maybe a Soviet or like an extra spoon and something was friends are going to get it for them. Okay, but I think just all set to go and ask for it themselves. All right, even if it takes longer, even if"
"Until and show up, but they learned from their. Can we apply the same thing, to Lord? I think we can expect some of the things that you believe. All right? Almost in position to let go and let whoever you maybe you are the heart or your children, learn to do it for themselves. But I do agree that it is easier said than done like my own personal experience. I told myself so many times to let my ex Jordan do many things on his own but in the end I still can't let it go soon as I see if I might be able to clean the trash bin knowing that he would have done himself just that you may take a few more days to maybe have where were around people who will offer to do things. Yeah. We know who will attempt to do it. Even if it's not up to send that. To example, there are people who are in relationships where the other party just cannot go."
"2 foots about it and will not do it. Then. I think this is something you have to realize during your dating face, which is why they always say traveling together is very good indication of whether this person is meant for you in the future when you get married because you get to see his at his lifestyle. He's headed for right, you know, whether or not he he does his his house work. I know he does his laundry is actually very, very important little things like this. I think many people feel the seediest. I think that, you know, if we can get married, but there's so much more. I think this methylone goes, if you for a lifetime, it's truly known as I brought this up, right? Because I, I sort of a friend okay, friend who was in this relationship to America, and I know that she talked about men to look quite a bit ago. She felt very, very bothered by it because it really felt like Noni that you were doing everything but"
"Food that you were alone in this, right? Yeah. That's the worst feeling. That's right, because it's not about delegating anymore on light. How come you never asked him to do that, But what is the other person? Cannot give a damn and will not do it. And you carry this load of which if you really insist that, if he's not going to do it I'm not going to do it. Right. Thing is going to get done by the house, would look like if it's saying that's how I like that."
"Is really the personality of two people, already is no longer the Menthol. Look of the woman herself. It is cause for concern, for sure. So, it'll other day that this episode was recorded. It's only been a few days since the government's announcement that more people can return to the office. And there were a lot of discussions going online about how this could be the end of work-life balance, but new city of friend, as examples to think perhaps it's the restarting of what life balance for working mothers and all women would so sick. And so, tired of doing all the jobs at home. That's true. I have you cut off when we fuss it. Like, working from home right now. Did you kill guys? Suddenly going omigosh now? I know like how much?"
"What my wife has to do all like this is the first time I'm realizing that, you know, it's really not easy or like the multi task of a million things. A lot of guys on the empathizing and understanding what the planets have to go through with booking from home and maybe the kids running around. Kids were also unlike Homebase learning right to do interrupting you every minute that was when they felt it before, you have kids and something happens. What does I know, right? I will come from home thing. It has helped so many people have to realize what I'm going through and I think this is great. It took a pandemic."
"Maybe got like a househusband. That's right. That's right. I'll like fathers who are the one setting. The kids every day. You never know. We are speaks to you. If you feel like you're carrying too much butter in a mental or in your, in your hearts as well. You know, we just want to share some ways where you can tell your partner, your caring too much of the mental. Okay, of course, I can share this podcast with your partner and it will send him the original comic by the cartoonist, who mentioned just now, as well as of what the mental load looks or feels like so maybe sometimes they just don't get it. You know, maybe they don't understand why it's so burning for you. Why it's so tiring for you to offer free sample. What are some of the mental emotional or otherwise invisible touch with you in charge of because maybe they don't see it sometimes, right? Because I think sometimes it's a little little little things, it looked it over when you add out, right? Because a lot and somebody"
"I think if you spell it out for them. Exactly, you know, like it you may see that it's small but like this this this this and then you spend it out and pray at top right. And I think it's crucial that you explain that you want to share the management. Not just the tours in self. You want them to take initiative instead of just wait for you to ask them to do things. I didn't mean to write. This is very important in a relationship. That's all right. So what you want for them, to feel the sense of responsibility and take pride in the thing because only with that, then you will get enough to think about it. Basically, I think what we're talking about here is showing the mental issues and be just the women experiencing the back of it. I think as fathers and mothers. If you have gone into this commitment to start a family together, you should be sharing all the burdens and responsibilities together as well. So don't be afraid to talk about it. Have a conversation together."
"Like how you would like when you're trying to solve an issue in the relationship and the talking, bitmain. I'll be like, oh, I don't think you might have to repeat until you feel like, oh my God. I'm going to die and Bubbles going to come out my mouth, but I think you keep at it longer. As long as you if you give up then you'll have to carry the mental note, your cell phone. I don't do that. So, can you OK? Corral mama need to get my dad to help a lot when the cold water, They may not realize, that's right.

Because my mother is super, super particular with the house. For example, Mary particular. It has to be none of us in this quick and this spic and span grounding. You let go, let go when it gets too much. Think about like, you know, it's just going to kill me. If it isn't, then you can live with it. That's right. That's right.

It's like, it's like sending things like, let's say a strap for your mom asked me to show you guys the amount of things that I bought that I'm not going to be useful after this pandemic, and it's got to do with mask mask, mask accessories. You don't lose your mom asked me this number 10. So have so many mossholders. Why do I need some insight? Then you can fold it and put it in your what I just won."
"Then you can look it up. Look at these shoes. I think a flight from Moscow accessories, right? This very place that I'm in right now.

I bought it after the circuit breaker for work. And you know what? I'm not someone might as well go to like a salt or any websites like to look for a new staff to buy, but I do fall prey to the sponsor on my Instagram. Like, I'm not even kidding you, I would just pop up news stories. This this how to get it resolved. That is 15 USDA for."
"Who led the dinosaur or the dinosaur? I love that. He disappeared on my Instagram story sponsor as one day and then I just went into the link and I bought it within like 2 minutes. So efficient. Are you the ways to make a woman's money and things like that, right? So I'm That Kind of buses will feel like when you still at Shop Rite that you, if you buy, you say 50%, but if you don't bite, you say 500%. But if you buy, you say 50%."
"Okay, but I mean online shopping is something that we've done for years even before the pandemic maybe a bit more now, but have you guys, at any point in your life felt embarrassed by your online shopping habits ish? But it's your money used for other things. It's all under control. So what if she cool. I know I have. But why am I, why am I stuck in those? You myself in all these online activities getting even with her jeans when I can be saving the Earth. That's what I link Yahoo! Okay, I was thinking like that. I have spent the money on something else, like a vested it. I don't know, but I do feel a bit guilty sometimes, especially when you are."
"At the same time, but I do like your Parcels or bring it to your room last time. He has, like I do becoming a video DJ but now you know, what can just hide you my way through? Because I will always have tell my parents."
"He would have. I never thought of that before, my mother doesn't see this up. Then I can use it on her, but you do. I hide things in my budget says I'm going to check out like many items, right? Okay. I love you. And I'll be like"
"Okay, OK. Google, OK. Google"
"She feel like she makes a lot of noise about how my things are. Overflowing, right. Like, you way too many food. It's ridiculous. But I mean, I think we all have this problem. We said the water was too that. I feel like it's just a mom thing. They just tend to nag. But, you know, I will talk to on that a bit more late. Then why we feel this way, why we feel guilty or the need to hide. But he, this is just it's been booming obvious by you do in the in the last year because a lot of people have sent it to put it online because of covid-19 and in Singapore, a study showed that 74% of consumers that is three out of four of us a shopping online frequently because of this pandemic and I guess it makes sense. Reschedule leave our homes with get to contract the virus when we go out to the mall and stuff like that, but we find ourselves embarrassed, when it arrives at our door, and also I think Tik-Tok has just been absolutely"
"Kind of like encouraging me to buy things when I see something on Tik-Tok. I want, I'll check it out. We didn't dream. It is true and similar to Asura. I tend to hide from my mom."
"When my package comes right, sometimes I'm not at home to receive it. That's the second thing. They need to pay GST above $400. You have to be a GSD, right? So, my mom will have to pay the GSD. This, you will be like when you buy a G Becky pool, where you buy a, I had to be GST for, you know, I paid $70 to USD. $70 means. How much do you spend on your on your thingy that you were going count? $70 is a, how much is 100%."
"But but I know if a little bit for the cheapest deal, I sold them by letter."
"In all honesty, like, I buy like seven pieces of a cooling every now and then, if I feel like it, you know, but recently, I feel like I've been wanting to save up my money a bit more, putting them to investment, and let my long-term goals. Yeah, so I don't usually so a lot and I think I'm very blessed. All three of us, have a blessed. Know, we always receive that. Put out some clients and I honestly don't think I like anyting at the moment. I don't find myself something a lot more now that the pandemic has like happened but I do, I do like to indulge in some laundry every now and then."
"I feel like you don't give me confidence and like it's makes me happy is a little things of being a woman. You know what I mean? And I have to stay there is someone who is very, very kind. Every time she buys things. Right? She wasn't by for me and Asura, I love to give me some idea to buy ridiculous. But let me pose a question to you guys, right? For us. Maybe we've gotten over a bit of the embarrassment of excessive shopping. But why do you think in general, women feel the need to lie about their online purchase?"
"Guilt and maybe different types of guilt. Just like and I think sometimes you're aware, that doesn't make sense because it's the old money. It makes you happy, you know, I mean, it doesn't bother anybody. My name is get like, you know, but she knows you already have a lot of stuff. So that's something I feel. Maybe it's also the mothers or maybe a little bit more, maybe the environment Anakin's body back down. Say my mother is someone who is so Thrifty know like he doesn't dump is closed until like he absolutely has to and I think he is positive qualities down to me and my sister and my brother. To every time I buy something, you I feel a bit of guilt and also maybe the nagging Parts like"
"What is the LG G put in a note in the script? She mentioned that to me. She lies about her purchases to her parents and her other half. So for example, if she dyes her hair for like, say $300 to tell them, you're the only cost like $200. And if she buys is it for like 60 bucks. Just tell them we talk prices like $30."
What is that? She does not want to be neck at and like she was about to go so expensive. So I wanted to have a hot spot cuz we had mentioned at the bias in Elbert that cost like
I think so. I think we'll was 4990. Yes. Yes. Yes. Because I had to lie on the Chanel.
But you didn't you thought you liked to? Who my mother? How much it cost. I don't know why 4990.
"Until a mummy on sale home. We can tell her for you outside guilty. Does it change with the electronics? So, for example, expensive, items versus cheap items? How do you guys actually tackle this? Yes, I'm proud. And you look how about so much? Because he can get a cheap price and we are proud of it. Is that okay?"
"Okay, then I just bought something. Okay. Okay, but this is an expensive thing. So you asked me how much is it to thought I would do? I would literally be like, why don't you tell her? Because I feel like she was mad at me. I just want to avoid that too expensive or already. I know what you mean. You would rather not tell her the truth. I would rather not tell her. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, then lie to her about when it comes to frivolous shopping vs. Essential shopping, so one but doesn't need it. You you don't feel guilty because it's justifiable."
"Especially when I buy it. Like I mentioned shampoo for the family know, my sister and I can use it. So is that, you know, I buy one thing I can say I know is essential and it makes me happy. But if I say like a bat is frivolous shopping right now, so I have something right that I bought recently, that is both frivolous and essential at the same time. So I saw a Mite, my friend phone in Jane, right? Where this new mask from where I can share a disposable masks from Japan."
"This is a box. Okay, so essential right? I need a mask. I need to protect myself. But this Muska, you guess how much come from Japan. I'm going to go with like 10 94. One box of 10 pieces. Is $40 a piece of this stupid. So when I told my mother,"
"Is a reusable. No, Mommy."
"That's the kind of conversation. So I don't want to get in through. You know, I mean, right? What you get lying, what I mean. So it is that when does this price? Is it a such thing as I get in the right now that it's more expensive than the usual. You know, what, maybe $15 for a box of 50, that is less than $0.50 per mask. So that's why, so many reasons why we want to hang out, but it's a lie about it, one of it. We already talked about it to avoid any arguments and to kind of like acid control over your purchase. This was my purchase. I don't argue with you about it, and I didn't want psychology."
"Considering that what we have bought, gives women a sense of control. Like nobody sees, you don't have to confront our shopping habits. And this is until you know, we can't allow ourselves to project an air of being calm and collected just the way you want to be is deliriously. So many houses with family members. Actually, right? I feel like we're lucky. We're very lucky in the sense that we have Partners were actually okay with us shopping. They won't say anything about it. It's just how you feel. You know, I can imagine that people out there who actually have to hide it from the partners, as a necessity, controlling abusive or, you know, just absolutely will not lie."
"I think that the actually need that they probably don't shop very much because they can't, but when they do, they probably even have to let hide it. Like maybe, I guess. Because they will get the trouble or, you know, they get hot in that process. That's true. I think like you spend within your means but you should never emotionally manipulated your partner, you know, it's getting bad about buying something that that they feel good about, especially if they have, the means to buy it. In fact, I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing. But when I go out that say, I go in vs in that shop, right? If I go alone, right? I guarantee you. I will spend much lesser than if I go with Issa. So many things is correct. Correct, correct. Cuz when you think about it, right? You were thinking like do I really need my life?"
"Accidental purchase. Last week. I went in to get something else and then and while she was processing, my punches, I decided to stand up and walk around. And because I walked, I swallowed it and then come cute, husband who is an enabler and then I just bought baby at the day. I don't think I should buy why so soon."
"Can we see, how did he pay? Did he pay for the back?"
We are very blessed people like they did. Good good. Husband can keep you show us.
You can slide up slide up.
"Then why you don't show it to Key removal removal when it's triggered by guilt. We feel guilty spending so much about money when we could have spend it on something else. It would give us higher returns at right. You just need to treat yourself, especially if let's say you've settled like your school fees, you settled this, the basic necessities and you have extra right? I think the rule that I always go by is that okay hide if you want to shop a buy things to yourself, treat yourself, as long as you didn't have to suffer for it. You don't have to like, green beans safe for it. It will not any other areas of your life. It's naturally you spend this money. You still have enough to get by, you still have your savings, you not touching a savings for it. Then I think you can go ahead and see. Like, I don't think that you should be in debt over materialistic things with credit card debt."
"Then at the end of the month, but I do. So you should never be in debt over material things and like as a general rule of thumb. I have many Financial friends like financial reasons why I like my friend. Telling me that, you know, you should allocate a certain amount of your salary every month for different needs that you have. So for example, is important to pamper yourself. He is it's right. This way you get the emotions of support from, right? Maybe just picked up to 10% of your salary for all this kind of emotional for it. So you don't spend it and then you find a way to fill out the whole thing. You give yourself this amount of money and once I'm done with the amount of money for the month, that's it. You're done. Don't need that money, never spend that part and percent."
"Even back up next month. Interesting. I'm going to try and do that. I'm going to try and see how much shopping with greet with shopping is usually one in on me. Right? And once I get there, if it's actually said for women to feel this compulsion to hide, what they fought is very similar to other addictions, you get a sense of anxiety and a sort of Shame attached to shopping and hiding. The purchase is an attempt to hide the shame. I think that makes sense. Well, this entire episode we're on the topic of let you know, hiding the chases. I would just like to bring out that. It also can be a serious issue especially if you fall into the compulsive buying category of people, so if you are a compulsive liar, this means that you cannot be this. You had this uncontrollable urge that results in excessive expensive and time-consuming with your activity."
Mom has Stacy.
"Because right over the last one, you're right. She's gotten into you do crystals and stuff like that. Right? Right, right. Yeah. So right now I'm thinking she has a collection of definitely more than fifty crystals and above a table of it. Just one year."
"Spend a lot on this Christmas like you. They cost a lot. They cost a lot because they're good quality crystals, right? So yeah. I try not to say anything because I feel like it's her money. Spend it. However that you want, right question, right around where the crystals are improved."
"Good question. You don't go to the extent of like hanging crystals in my room to ward off negative energy. That's nice. Right? She thinks he's safe to put in his office to encourage welfare know, but I think she wants the best for everyone. So I try not to say anything about it, cuz I don't want her to say anything about my bike right now. So question. That's Uncle know how much and he's spending the great question."
"Let us give. Hello. Hello. My mom, generally tries to just not mention about it. And and I think he was a close one. I laughed. So many years of marriage actually, both eyes are closer. But I think he and I have to relearn that. It's not like that and I'll just buy I have to reload it. Money is how to make, you know, money is hard to come by. So you need to save up a lot from you as well."
"I grew up in a very traditional family. So whether our spouses or other half, no Bahamut, we spending about financial Fidelity know. This may seem like a small issue actually can accumulate and balloon to a bigger issue. I think a lot of us think that has a white lie, you don't like? But in terms of a relationship, if you are planning to get married finances, a huge part of that, and it can really be a bit toxic. It can cause foundational trust issues, and it can lead to your spouse feeling. Betrayed even know. What do you think is spending my question, right?"
"If you feel guilty about it, there must be a reason why. So, maybe you need to be honest with yourself. Will you spending out of your means? You know, who did you lie to your spouse? Because you felt bad that you were spending from your joint account. For example, you never know. These are things that happen to people, but we would encourage just having open and honest communication. If you can't even communicate to your spouse openly about Finance is this and what you want to marry spending money is not bad, but I feel like saving money, but let me just okay. So I feel like this is something that has happened to me growing up, right, where where people make me feel guilty that my parents spend money on me because I guess, you know, they see that they give me material things like my dad, bought me a card stuff like that. So they make me feel bad for that. Like they call me names and stuff, but do me, right."
"Look so hot from having no money from being worried about buying milk powder for me. When I was born to coming to the state. She wants us to spend his money as it is very terrible to say that he himself has told us for some people to understand it and then he works so hard for his children, right? So he wants us to spend money to him. I spend his money is a good thing, no matter how weird that sounds. But that's how he shows his love, you out, like, this Empire from scratch. And I think it's absolutely fine that he's buying you. Your car is no, he, he he has a very nice big house for you guys to stay in there when he's been his money yet. If not in the way we do his money, hold it all the way. Like at some point you need to treat yourself as well. You need to write kind of look at how much you have."
"One for yourself and really just reward yourself for that. I know is never someone to depend on her parents. I mean, yeah, but she has always fought hard for her own achievements. That is a problem at home and they just know that."
I'm going to have money for my parents.
"I know so many people like that. So, I mean, not Jamaica, New York. She still think, and think and others versus you buy something before she buy one. When she has the means to do, you know, this is controlling your spending as in spending. Yes. Love. But, you know, being able to budget and to plan like hazy set, set aside an amount every month to treat yourself. I think that's the best way we can do that online. I mean if we try. Do you guys remember?"
"I decided to buy right. And I bought so many different kinds from things and boy, shot that I stuff like that, when they arrive. I happily show them off to ASAP. As I can. Look at this one. They can hold the three types of black."
"Where was so proud. And when I was wearing it, right? I told him to hold the deal is so comfortable at your is so dry it. Like, I feel so good at like, in this and he's happy for me. He's like, looking for, you don't know, I wouldn't hide if I bite into it products online unless it's like a sex toy or something, then probably."
"Mesa County is it together? And they look like and how do you say? I wouldn't be okay if I buy them from Stars, right? And then you try to get that mean to the the laundry basket. And that means I wouldn't want to learn to read with it. I bought like lingerie."
